## Information Extraction

Load scientific paper PDFs into structured data

- [x] metadata extraction
- [x] text extraction
- [ ] section association, Unstructured.io does it https://thedataguild.slack.com/archives/C05B9QZ9DRV/p1693951596478659?thread_ts=1693947861.704849&cid=C05B9QZ9DRV
- [ ] data cleaning

### Status

1. loaded PDFs with default pypdf. Lacking metadata and formatting Information from scientific paper style.
1. parsed PDFs with Grobid (see [issue #9](https://github.com/TheDataGuild/mind-palace/issues/9)). Extracted metadata and text. Lacking section association.
1. continue with Grobid and chunk body text
