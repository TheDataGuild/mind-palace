# Mind Palace

A sandbox demo to solve a murder mystery collaboratively using a small literary dataset with a murder mystery theme, e.g. Sherlock Holmes. This is a fun proof of concept for our drug hunters.

## Goals

Deliver multiple "Aha" moments to our audience (i.e. drug hunters)

1. Showcase how multiple people can do detective work collaboratively, seeing how each person's notes can contribute to solving the case
1. Showcase 1000x signal-noise reduction in interacting with abstracted literature vs reading the papers
1. ??

## Information architecture

```
       /  User                    \
      / visualization              \
     / T-SNE dimensional reduction  \
    /  relation graph representation \
   /   attribute extraction           \
  /    literary dataset                \
```
