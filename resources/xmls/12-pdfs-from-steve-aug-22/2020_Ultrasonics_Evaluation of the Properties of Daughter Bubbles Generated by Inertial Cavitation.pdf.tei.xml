<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inertial cavitation (IC) of the preformed microbubbles is being investigated for ultrasound imaging and therapeutic applications. However, microbubbles rupture during IC, creating smaller daughter bubbles (DBs), which may cause undesired bioeffects in the target region. Thus, it is important to determine the properties of DBs to achieve controllable cavitation activity for applications. In this study, we theoretically calculated the dissolution dynamics of sulfur hexafluoride bubbles. Then, we applied a 1-MHz single tone burst with different peak negative pressures (PNPs) and pulse lengths (PLs), and multiple 5-MHz tone bursts with fixed acoustic conditions to elicit IC of the preformed SonoVue microbubbles and scattering of DBs, respectively.</p><p>After the IC and scattering signals were received by a 7.5-MHz transducer, time-and frequency-domain analysis was performed to obtain the IC dose and scattering intensity curve. The theoretical dissolution curves and measured scattering intensity curves were combined to determine the effect of the incident pulse parameters on the lifetime, mean radius and distribution range of DBs. Increasing the PNP reduced the lifetime and mean size of the DBs population and narrowed the size distribution. The proportion of small DBs (less than resonance size) increased from 36.83% to 85.98% with an increase in the PNP from 0.6 to 1.6 MPa. Moreover, increasing the PL caused a shift of the DB population to the smaller bubbles with shorter lifetime and narrower distribution. The proportion of small bubbles increased from 25.74% to 95.08% as the PL was increased from 5 to 100 µs. Finally, increasing the IC dose caused a smaller mean size, shorter lifetime and narrower distribution in the DB population. These results provide new insight into the relationship between the incident acoustic parameters and the properties of DBs, and a feasible strategy for achieving controllable cavitation activity in applications.</p></div>

Passive cavitation detection revealed that short rebound signals follow the IC signals, which also indicates that the preformed microbubbles rupture to form DBs <ref type="bibr" coords="4,426.97,404.03,18.99,10.54" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,449.81,404.03,14.25,10.54" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Before DBs disappear because of static dissolution, they are able to grow and collapse essentially as new bubbles, thus undergo similar acoustic responses as the preformed microbubbles (i.e. scattering, linear or non-linear oscillation and fragmentation) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,486.30,466.13,18.99,10.54" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,90.00,486.82,14.25,10.54" target="#b17">18]</ref>. This acoustically-driven behavior, which is closely related to the properties of the DBs, including gas diffusion, dissolution velocity and size distribution, may cause undesirable and uncontrolled bioeffects in the targeted region, such as cell necrosis or hemorrhage, thus influencing the biosafety and efficiency of ultrasound-based applications <ref type="bibr" coords="4,151.19,569.62,14.62,10.54" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,165.81,569.62,4.87,10.54" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,170.68,569.62,14.62,10.54" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Therefore, to control the biological responses elicited by IC, it is crucial to determine the properties of the DBs generated by IC.</p><p>Various optical and acoustic methods have been used to estimate the lifetime and size distribution of cavitation bubbles and their relationships with the parameters of the used incident pulse. For example, two laser techniques, including laser diffraction and phase Doppler interferometry, are commonly used to measure the size distribution of microbubble clouds (e.g. from distilled water exposed to a 20-kHz horn) for different acoustic pressures <ref type="bibr" coords="4,180.52,714.50,18.99,10.54" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,202.78,714.50,14.25,10.54" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Sonoluminescence (i.e. the light emission from collapsing microbubbles) or sonochemical luminescence (i.e. the light produced through chemical reaction of hydroxyl radicals with luminol) have also been used to determine the cavitation bubbles size for different acoustic frequencies and powers <ref type="bibr" coords="5,446.02,95.96,19.00,10.54" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,470.66,95.96,14.25,10.54" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In another study, the void rate curve of bubbles measured using an electromagnetic resonator and the theoretical dissolution curve revealed that the size distribution of a cavitation bubble cloud (from air-saturated water exposed to 308-kHz ultrasound) is related to the acoustic pulse shape, acoustic pressure and exposure time <ref type="bibr" coords="5,461.94,178.75,18.99,10.54" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.30,178.75,14.25,10.54" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, a recent study that used a time-intensity curve and bubble dissolution kinetics found that increasing the pulse length (PL) and PNP increases the proportion of large bubbles and small bubbles (from the nanodroplets exposed to a tone bust pulse of 1.2-MHz), respectively <ref type="bibr" coords="5,222.56,261.54,18.39,10.54" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Numerical calculations have also predicted that the active cavitation bubble size decreases and the size distribution narrows with increasing acoustic frequency, and that the radius decreases with increasing acoustic pressure <ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.30,302.94,19.00,10.54" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,90.00,323.64,14.25,10.54" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Although the original of the cavitation bubbles (e.g. distilled water, luminol solution and nano-or micro-droplets that exposed to acoustic waves with high PNP) are essentially different from that of DBs (e.g. preformed microbubbles), these methods can also be used for reference to analyze the properties of DBs. Notably, previous studies have discriminated small DBs based on the measured dissolution process and the resonance features of dissolving bubbles <ref type="bibr" coords="5,319.66,427.13,18.39,10.54" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, there has not been a comprehensive study evaluating the effect of the incident acoustic parameters on the properties of DBs generated by IC of the preformed bubbles.</p><p>In this study, we established an experimental platform to evaluate the properties (lifetime, mean size and distribution range) of the DB population produced by IC of preformed SonoVue microbubbles. A single tone burst with different PNPs or PLs was used to elicit the fragmentation of microbubbles in an agarose phantom. Multiple tone bursts with fixed low PNP, PL and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) were used to track the temporal distribution of the scattering intensity of the resulting DBs. The lifetime and size distribution were calculated from the experimentally determined scattering intensity curves and the theoretically calculated dissolution curves of the DBs. Finally, the relationships between the properties of the DBs and the PNP and PL of the incident single tone burst were statistically determined.</p></div>

The preformed microbubble solution was then diluted with degassed PSS to a concentration of 0.1% v/v with an estimated 2-5×10 5 microbubbles per milliliter, which is lower than that used in clinical ultrasound imaging <ref type="bibr" coords="6,379.93,202.90,18.40,10.54" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>A cubic agarose-gel phantom (20 mm × 20 mm × 20 mm) was fabricated according to the details described in our previous reports <ref type="bibr" coords="6,368.17,244.29,18.99,10.54" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,390.45,244.29,14.25,10.54" target="#b33">34]</ref>. A cavity (10 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm) in the bottom of the phantom was deliberately reserved to contain the preformed microbubble suspension. After the suspension was gently added into the cavity, the cavity was carefully sealed with a thin film.

Specifically, a 3.3 V signal 1 was generated to trigger signal generator 1 (33120A, Agilent Technologies, USA) to produce a single sinusoid signal with varied PNP and PL.

This produced multiple tone bursts signals with a PNP of 0.08 MPa, PRF of 1 kHz and PL of 4 µs. A third square wave (signal 3) with a PRF of 1 kHz, which was synchronous with signal 1, was created by MSP430.

A damping material (UA-1, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) was placed at the bottom of the water tank to minimize acoustic reflections, thereby forming a travelling wave field during exposure. Specifically, first, a single sinusoid signal with 1 MHz frequency and varied voltage amplitude and cycles (i.e. PL), produced by the signal generators 1 and amplified by a 50-dB radiofrequency amplifier (2100L; Electronics &amp;Innovation Ltd, USA), was used to drive a 1-MHz single element plane transducer T1 with active diameter of 25.4 mm (Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA). This transducer was placed at a distance of 80 mm from the microbubble suspension in the agarose-gel phantom. This position was above the theoretical nearfield of the transducer on the acoustic axis, reducing the influence of slight variations in position (due to installment) on the acoustic pressure distribution in the target region.</p><p>Because this transducer was used to elicit the violent collapse and disintegration of the preformed SonoVue microbubbles, the PNP should exceed the PNP threshold for inducing IC of the microbubbles. We varied the PNP and PL to analyze the influence of these parameters on the properties of the DBs. Next, 1 ms after the emission of the single tone burst, the multiple tone bursts signal with 5 MHz frequency, fixed voltage amplitude, PL and PRF, (output from signal generator 2 and amplified by another 50-dB radiofrequency amplifier), was applied to drive a 5-MHz plane transducer (T2) (Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA). This transducer had an active diameter of 13 mm and was installed at a distance of 50 mm from the sample region. We note that the pulse parameters need to be rationally selected to obtain a temporal distribution of the scattering intensity of DBs. According to our preliminary measurements, a 1-kHz PRF was selected to achieve high temporal resolution when tracking the static dissolution process of DBs and to avoid acousticallydriven diffusion, which can occur at higher PRFs.

The fitted scattering intensity curve in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="19,124.40,521.09,14.66,10.54" target="#fig_10">5A</ref> shows that the amplitudes of the scattering signals from the bubble solution (which was excited by a single tone burst with 0.6-MPa PNP) continuously decreased in the first ~150 ms, and then gradually approached a stable level (close to that in the control saline solution) after ~220 ms. This trend indicates that the scattering crosssection of the DB population gradually decreased owing to the decreasing bubble radius during static dissolution. From Figure <ref type="figure" coords="19,285.23,624.58,11.78,10.54" target="#fig_10">5A</ref>, we can see that the scattering intensity deceased to 0.16×10 -6 v 2 s at ~225 ms after exposure to multiple tone bursts, followed by a very small reduction (less than the 1% of the maximum intensity) in the next time, so ~225 ms corresponds to the lifetime of the DB population. The calculated size distribution of DBs is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="19,286.82,707.37,11.33,10.54" target="#fig_10">5C</ref>. The distribution was Gaussian, with the proportions of bubbles larger and smaller than the resonance size (≈ 0.86 µm) being 65.70% and 34.30%, respectively. The corresponding mean size and FWHH were 1.21 µm and 1.52 µm, respectively. By contrast, after exposure to a single tone burst with PNP of 1.6 MPa, similar scattering intensity trend but with a faster decay was observed in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="20,135.18,116.66,11.34,10.54" target="#fig_10">5B</ref>, suggesting a faster dissolution rate of the DBs formed. Similar distribution characteristics can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="20,270.94,137.35,11.78,10.54" target="#fig_10">5D</ref>, although the lifetime (89.37 ms), mean size (0.77 µm) and FWHH (0.82 µm) are smaller in this case. The relationships between the PNP and the lifetime, mean bubble size and FWHH are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="20,188.98,575.12,12.40,10.54" target="#fig_10">5E</ref>-G, respectively. The lifetime decreases from 222.5 to 76.3 ms with an increase of the PNP from 0.6 to 1.6 MPa. In the DB population, the proportion of corresponding smaller bubbles (&lt; resonance size) increased from 36.83% to 85.98% while the proportion of larger bubbles (&gt; resonance size) decreased from 63.17% to 14.02%. With increasing PNP, the mean bubble size decreased from 1.21 to 0.70 µm and the distribution (FWHH) narrowed from 1.52 to 0.79 µm. These results show that the increasing PNP caused a shift of DBs to smaller bubbles with shorter life time.  The relationships between the PL of the incident single tone burst and the lifetime, mean size and FWHH of DBs are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,346.42,623.42,24.80,10.54" target="#fig_12">6E-G</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,416.96,623.42,13.33,10.54" target="#fig_12">6E</ref> shows that the lifetime gradually decreased with increasing PL. The rate of decrease was greatest at PL &lt; 20 µs, suggesting that these PLs have the greater influence on the formation of large DBs. The proportion of large bubbles (&gt; resonance size) decreased with increasing PL, from 74.26% for a 5-µs pulse to 4.92% for a 100-µs pulse. The corresponding proportion of small bubbles (&lt; resonance size) increased from 25.74% to 95.08%. Moreover, it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,256.32,747.60,12.67,10.54" target="#fig_12">6F</ref> and 6G that with increasing PL from 5 to 100 µs, the mean size of the DBs decreased from 1.45 µm to 0.58 µm, and the FWHH decreased from 2.07 to 0.53 µm. These results show that the increasing PL caused a larger proportion of small bubbles with shorter lifetime in the DB population.</p></div>

Based on their observation, we conclude that the preformed microbubbles fragmented into DBs because the scattering intensity rapidly decreased to a relatively lower level than that obtained before the single tone burst emission. Moreover, the size of DBs (0.23-2.7 µm) in their study is in agreement with our results, showing the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>Our results show that an increase of the PNP reduces the lifetime and mean size of the DB population (due to the increase of small bubble), and narrows the size distribution range. A previous study that measured void rate dissipation showed that an increase in acoustic pressure increased the proportion of small bubbles in the cavitation bubble cloud <ref type="bibr" coords="22,157.39,466.85,18.39,10.54" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Other studies using the ultrasound wide-beam method also found that a higher PNP favored the formation of the small bubbles in acoustic droplet vaporization. Therefore, our results are consistent with those of these studies. Further, early optical observations, which provide direct proof of this relationship, determined that a higher PNP can increase the amplitude (in the expansion phase) of microbubble oscillation, and increase the velocity and acceleration of the shell wall (i.e. enhancing instability) <ref type="bibr" coords="22,145.76,591.04,18.39,10.54" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This means that the violent collapse produces more shell fragments, resulting in the larger proportion of small DBs.</p><p>Our results also show that a longer PL causes a shift of the DB population to the smaller bubbles with shorter lifetime and narrower distribution. This result is also consistent with an early study, which used the 'rebound' signal to detect DBs generated by the rupture of the preformed bubbles <ref type="bibr" coords="22,276.31,694.53,20.11,10.54" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In that study, the amplitude of the rebound signal markedly increased with PL for a given incident PNP, indicative of more small bubbles in DBs population <ref type="bibr" coords="22,220.84,735.93,18.40,10.54" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, other studies have reported that a longer PL increases the size of cavitation bubbles <ref type="bibr" coords="23,293.52,75.26,18.39,10.54" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This discrepancy may be due to the following reason. The DBs in our study were produced from pre-formed microbubbles exposed to a single tone burst, whereas cavitation bubbles are formed from the solution (e.g. degassed water, luminol solution and nanodroplets solution) exposed to highintensity ultrasound. Moreover, in previous studies, no obvious increase was observed in the extent of bubble expansion when increasing the PL; however, a longer PL was found to cause preformed microbubbles to produce more shell fragments, therefore resulting in the increase in the proportion of small bubbles <ref type="bibr" coords="23,367.10,220.15,18.99,10.54" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,388.48,220.15,14.25,10.54" target="#b13">14]</ref>. In addition, a longer PL could cause the coalescence of cavitation bubbles or gas diffusion from the surrounding medium, leading to an increase in the mean bubble size <ref type="bibr" coords="23,419.90,261.54,19.00,10.54" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,441.90,261.54,15.00,10.54" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,459.90,261.54,14.25,10.54" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="23,142.20,282.24,13.33,10.54" target="#fig_8">3E</ref> and 3F show that the IC dose positively correlated with the PNP and PL.</p><p>Noted that the same sampling points (16384) (or sampling time ) 252.06 × 10 -6 µs were used when the PL was changed in the single tone burst. Therefore, ICD proportional to PL is mainly due to the increasing intensities of the broadband components (the increasing IC extent). Moreover, the degree of microbubble rupture increased with increasing PNP and PL <ref type="bibr" coords="23,275.47,386.41,19.00,10.54" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,297.17,386.41,15.00,10.54" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,314.87,386.41,15.00,10.54" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,332.56,386.41,14.25,10.54" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Therefore, we conclude that the increase of the IC dose can cause an increase in the degree of microbubble rupture, resulting in a large proportion of small DBs with a short lifetime and narrow distribution. This trend is consistent with the results of previous studies looking at the effect of acoustic power using laser diffraction and phase Doppler interferometry <ref type="bibr" coords="23,461.76,469.20,18.99,10.54" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="23,486.30,469.20,14.25,10.54" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, our results differ from those obtained using the sonoluminescence intensity method, which determined that the radius increases with an increase in acoustic power <ref type="bibr" coords="23,90.00,531.29,18.39,10.54" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This may due to the relativity low acoustic power range used in this research. However, at higher acoustic power, numerical calculations of multi-bubble systems determine that because of the stronger nonlinear pulsations, the radius decreases with the increasing acoustic pressure (from increasing acoustic power) <ref type="bibr" coords="23,407.21,593.39,18.39,10.54" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>

It is known that when the excitation frequency approaches the resonance frequency of the bubbles, the bubbles start to resonate <ref type="bibr" coords="23,346.88,707.88,18.40,10.54" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Thus, during the dissolution process of DBs, the change of scattering cross-section with the radius will undergo a resonance peak, and doesn't follow the exponential decay function. However, in our lots of repeated experiments, the temporal curve of the measured scattering intensity still exhibited exponential attenuation trend, and almost no obviously sudden change (corresponding to the resonance peak) was observed. Previous report explained that the resonance peak for each bubble may be smeared due to the polydispersity of the DBs population, resulting in the exponential decay of the measured scattering intensity <ref type="bibr" coords="24,482.32,158.05,18.39,10.54" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, similar to the previous report <ref type="bibr" coords="24,265.48,178.75,19.99,10.54" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , the exponential decay function was used to fit the time variation of scattering cross-section during the static dissolution process.</p><p>On the other hand, although another exponential decay function was fitted to eliminate the influence of the resonance peak, the modified scattering cross-section will cause some errors in the estimated size distribution. Therefore, to obtain accurate size distribution of DBs, using monodisperse microbubbles or a single microbubble may ensure the curve of measured scattering intensity is consistent with the theoretical calculations.</p><p>According to the theoretical calculation, the dissolution time of DBs with 0.2 µm radius is ~1.6 ms. The time interval between turning off the 1MHz ultrasound and turning on the 5 MHz ultrasound is 1 ms in this measurement system. The propagation time of acoustic waves in experimental system is ~85.67 µs. So, the minimal radius that can be differentiated by this system was ~0.2 µm, and DBs with radius less than 0.2 µm can't detected. Thus, some smaller DBs may be out of consideration when using this measurement system. More fast and accurate measurement system is needed for the cases of smaller DBs generation.</p><p>Previous experimental and numerical studies also determined that a higher acoustic frequency increases the proportion of small cavitation bubbles and narrows the size distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="24,172.05,551.31,18.99,10.54" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="24,195.11,551.31,14.25,10.54" target="#b23">24]</ref>. The expansion amplitude of the preformed bubbles is also dependent on the ultrasonic frequency, with previous studies showing that a lower frequency increases the expansion amplitude and fragmentation, which increases the number of small bubbles <ref type="bibr" coords="24,227.15,613.41,18.40,10.54" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, due to the limitation of experimental conditions, we did not investigate the influence of the ultrasound frequency on the properties of the DB population. This will be performed in future work.</p></div>

Our method to determine the properties of DBs can provide a feedback for optimizing the incident acoustic parameters (i.e. the PNP, PL and center frequency). For example, although some pulse modes (e.g. short pulses with high PRF) achieve uniform spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation dose in the target region <ref type="bibr" coords="25,417.96,116.66,18.99,10.54" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="25,441.40,116.66,14.25,10.54" target="#b40">41]</ref>, the DBs formed by the previous incident pulse may generate secondary cavitation after receiving the next incident pulse, resulting in non-uniform distribution of the cavitation activity.</p><p>To eliminate these undesired acoustic responses, the PRF in short-pulse mode should be as long as possible to exceed the lifetime of DBs.

We determined that increasing the PNP reduces the lifetime and mean size of the DB population, and narrows the size distribution. Moreover, increasing the PL increases the proportion of small bubbles with short lifetime, and narrows the size distribution of the DBs. We conclude that the IC dose is related to the properties of the DB population. With increasing IC dose, the mean bubble size decreases, the lifetime of the DB population shortens and its size distribution narrows. Thus, this study shows that the properties of DBs can be predetermined according to the parameters of the incident acoustic pulse, and that controllable cavitation activity can be achieved by optimizing the acoustic parameters.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,90.00,638.02,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,653.89,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,669.76,415.31,10.54;7,90.00,685.63,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,701.50,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,717.36,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,733.23,415.30,10.54;7,90.00,749.10,156.28,10.54;7,109.90,423.87,375.51,203.32"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The scattering intensity of the DBs formed after the 50-µs pulse exhibited faster exponential decay than for those formed after the 10-µs pulse (Figure 6A and 6B), suggesting that longer pulse can cause faster dissolution rate of DBs.
