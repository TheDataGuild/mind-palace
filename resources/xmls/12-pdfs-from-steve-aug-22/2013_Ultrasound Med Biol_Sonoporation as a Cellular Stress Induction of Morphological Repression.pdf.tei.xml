<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For sonoporation to be established as a drug/gene delivery paradigm, it is essential to account for the biological impact of this membrane permeation strategy on living cells. Here we provide new insight into the cellular impact of sonoporation by demonstrating in vitro that this way of permeating the plasma membrane may inadvertently induce repressive cellular features even while enhancing exogenous molecule uptake. Both suspension-type (HL-60) and monolayer (ZR-75-30) cells were considered in this investigation, and they were routinely exposed to 1-MHz pulsed ultrasound (pulse length, 100 cycles; pulse repetition frequency, 1 kHz; exposure period, 60 s) with calibrated field profile (spatial-averaged peak negative pressure, 0.45 MPa) and in the presence of microbubbles (cell:bubble ratio, 10:1). The post-exposure morphology of sonoporated cells (identified as those with calcein internalization) was examined using confocal microscopy, and their cell cycle progression kinetics were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results show that for both cell types investigated, sonoporated cells exhibited membrane shrinkage and intra-cellular lipid accumulation over a 2-h period. Also, as compared with normal cells, the deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis duration of sonoporated cells was significantly lengthened, indicative of a delay in cell cycle progression. These features are known to be characteristics of a cellular stress response, suggesting that sonoporation indeed constitutes as a stress to living cells. This issue may need to be addressed in optimizing sonoporation for drug/gene delivery purposes. On the other hand, it raises opportunities for developing other therapeutic applications via sonoporation.</p></div>

With the increasing level of technical maturity in realizing sonoporation, there is a growing interest in gaining a deeper understanding of the cellular response related to this biophysical phenomenon.

From a drug/gene delivery standpoint, it is important to address this fundamental question because preservation of cell viability is generally of high priority in many applications (except, perhaps, for cancer treatment).</p><p>For sonoporated cells to remain viable, membrane resealing is unarguably crucial, and this is known to take place within seconds after exposure through a calcium ion (Ca 21 )-mediated mechanism that presumably involves patching of the permeated site with intracellular vesicles <ref type="bibr" coords="1,372.76,656.65,81.77,8.76" target="#b11">(Hassan et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,457.80,656.65,65.19,8.76" target="#b36">Zhou et al. 2008</ref>).

This signifies that sonoporation may essentially pose a stress to living cells, and it may represent a confounding factor when using sonoporation for drug/gene delivery purposes. Indeed, recent statistics have prompted reservations over whether sonoporation can on its own serve as an efficient drug delivery strategy in which large drug payloads can be delivered into cells without affecting cell viability in tandem <ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.89,186.48,64.16,8.76" target="#b20">(Liu et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>To counteract the repressive impact of sonoporation and, in turn, maintain cell viability, cytoprotection strategies would likely need to be administered in parallel.

However, without a proper account of the mechanistic pathways involved in the sonoporation-induced stress response, it would be futile to pursue further development of these strategies for use beyond the initial proof-of-principle stage, as other unintended bioeffects may be overlooked.</p><p>In this investigation, it is our aim to understand better how sonoporation may be acting as a stress on biological cells so as to facilitate optimization of the sonoporation-mediated drug/gene delivery paradigm. Specifically, we seek to obtain insight into the cytotoxic impact of sonoporation by gaining new perspectives on anti-proliferative characteristics that may emerge within sonoporated cells after membrane resealing has occurred. Our investigation is guided by two research hypotheses. First, because sonoporation involves physical wounding of cell membrane and subsequent resealing through intra-cellular vesicle patching, the morphology of sonoporated cells under recovery must inherently differ from that of normal viable cells. Second, as part of the stress response, the cell cycle progression kinetics of sonoporated cells must be modified from those of normal cells. As such, this work has focused on elucidating repressive morphological features and developmental disturbances that may arise in sonoporated cells over time as they undergo recovery after membrane resealing.</p></div>

The HL-60 leukemia cell line (CCL-240; American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA) was used as the suspension model, whereas the ZR-75-30 breast carcinoma cell line (CRL-1504; ATCC) was used as the attached cell model. Note that cancerous cell lines have been chosen for this study in view of their immortality and natural resistance to proapoptotic stress (these prosurvival characteristics would effectively serve as part of the experimental control for our investigation, which aims to demonstrate the repressive impact of sonoporation). Both cell lines were routinely cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (R8758; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.86,234.60,63.91,8.76">(FBS, 30-2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.17,234.60,26.18,8.76">ATCC)</ref>. The cell culture incubator was kept at 37 C with 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Asynchronous and exponential cell growth was maintained by monitoring cell density to ensure that it did not exceed 10 6 cells/mL (for HL-60) or 10 7 cells in an 80-cm 2 culture flask (for ZR-75-30).</p><p>One day before the experiment, the cells were fed with fresh medium. They were then extracted and transferred to custom-made chamber well slides, each of which was essentially an acrylic slab (80 mm in length, 30 mm in width, 5 mm in height) with a cylindrical well bore in the center (12-mm well diameter, 0.6-mL working volume). Note that prior to extraction, the ZR-75-30 cells were first resuspended using 0.25% trypsin (59428C; Sigma-Aldrich). Also, each chamber well slide was sealed respectively with a 0.13-mm-thick coverslip (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ, USA) at the bottom surface and a 0.18-mm-thick HybriWell cover (S24730; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the top surface. Transfer of cells into the chamber well was facilitated through two filling ports on the HybriWell cover, and these ports were patched with seal tabs (A18211; Invitrogen) after the transfer to ensure secured sealing.</p><p>In this work, a population of 1.2 3 10 6 cells was used for each sample of HL-60 cell suspension and for ZR-75-30 cell samples that underwent post-exposure flow cytometry assays. For ZR-75-30 cells used in confocal microscopy analysis, a smaller population of 10 4 cells was used in each sample to allow cells to reattach and form a cell monolayer on the chamber slide. To foster cell reattachment, this subset of samples was incubated for 24 h after cell transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="2,304.44,632.70,213.48,8.55">Ultrasound exposure platform: Technical description</head><p>To facilitate the application of ultrasound to cell samples, we have developed a custom exposure platform, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,394.29,668.78,3.74,8.76" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This three-level acrylic platform was immersed completely in a 37 C degassed water bath. At the bottom level is the ultrasound transducer (facing upward) with 1-MHz frequency and 2.54-cm diameter (P1T10W-25; Kunshan Rishun Electronics, Jiangsu, China). The transducer was driven by a signal generator setup that comprised an arbitrary waveform generator (33120A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a 50-dB-gain broadband amplifier (2100L; Electronics and Innovation, Rochester, NY, USA). The middle platform level, 7 cm above the transducer, housed the secure-sealed chamber well slide that was mounted upside down with the HybriWell cover facing the transducer (i.e., for the attached cells, the monolayer is positioned at the top of the slide). To help concentrate the ultrasound exposure at the chamber well slide, a 3.2cm-diameter aperture was drilled at the center of the middle level, and acoustic absorber (facing downward) was padded around the aperture. The upper platform level was positioned 7 cm above the middle level. It was padded with acoustic absorber to prevent ultrasound that reached the top of platform from reflecting back toward the cell sample. This was done to avoid standing waves from emerging, thereby improving the homogeneity of acoustic exposure conditions during operation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,53.40,656.67,79.27,8.76" target="#b12">(Hensel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,135.44,656.67,83.61,8.76" target="#b19">Leskinen et al. 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="3,53.40,680.91,186.00,8.55">Acoustic exposure parameters and calibration</head><p>To characterize the in situ ultrasound exposure level, measurements of peak negative pressure were made using a needle hydrophone (HNR-0500; Onda, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and a three-axis micropositioner (ASTS-01; Onda). In particular, a planar map of the peak negative pressure in the vicinity of the chamber well slide was obtained by taking hydrophone measurements at scan coordinates along the surface of the middle level's aperture (in the absence of the chamber well slide). To account for insertion loss on mounting the chamber well slide, a HybriWell cover (i.e., the slide's transducer-facing side) was mounted across the aperture prior to making the measurements (the hydrophone was calibrated to be 1 mm from this chamber to avoid tip contact). Note that the HybriWell cover is made of polycarbonate, and it is essentially an acoustically thin surface (0.18-mm slab thickness) with respect to the ultrasound wavelength at 1-MHz frequency (1.5 mm). Its acoustic attenuation coefficient was previously reported to be 0.5 dB/(mm$MHz) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,384.17,608.44,64.33,8.76" target="#b31">(Selfridge 1985)</ref>.</p><p>The insets to Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,404.41,620.45,4.98,8.76" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the measured peak negative pressure field that was applied in all our experiments. As can be observed, the pressure distribution was relatively homogeneous within the chamber zone (12 mm in diameter) as it was positioned within the pressure field's focal region and was significantly smaller than the field's full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 18.5 mm. Peak negative pressure values ranged between Upper left inset: Contour map of the peak negative pressure for the cross-sectional area across the chamber well as obtained from hydrophone measurements (each contour step denotes 0.05 MPa). Lower left inset: x-axis plot of the peak negative pressure along the y 5 0 line. Peak negative pressure within the chamber zone ranged between 0.40 and 0.51 MPa, and the corresponding spatial average was 0.45 MPa. Note that the chamber zone diameter was smaller than the pressure field's full width at half-maximum.</p><p>0.40 and 0.51 MPa over the planar cross section of the chamber well, and the corresponding spatial average was estimated to be 0.45 MPa. This ultrasound field was applied to each experimental trial in the form of 100-cycle pulses with 1-MHz center frequency. Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was set at 1 kHz (yielding a 10% duty cycle for our given pulse length), and exposure duration was kept at 60 s. As considered in previous dosage studies on sonoporation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,187.87,162.33,88.33,8.76" target="#b9">(Guzman et al. 2003)</ref>, these parameters correspond to a spatially averaged acoustic energy density of 41 J/cm 2 -a relatively mild ultrasound dosage that would not lead to cellular damage in a microbubble-free medium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="4,53.40,234.89,187.74,8.55">Use of microbubbles to facilitate sonoporation</head><p>Commercial lipid-shelled microbubbles (TS-108; Targeson, San Diego, CA, USA) were used to serve as artificial gas nuclei for sonoporation. These microbubbles were 2.09 mm in mean diameter, and less than 1.7% of them were larger than 5 mm (according to the manufacturer's data). They were added just before ultrasound exposure at a concentration corresponding to a 10:1 cell:bubble ratio within the chamber well (for confocal microscopy experiments done on attached cells, time was given to allow the microbubbles to rise to the top of the well slide where the cell monolayer was located). Such a cell:bubble ratio was chosen based on previous findings that demonstrated sonoporation efficiency was higher (i.e., achieving sonoporation while limiting cases of instant cell lysis) when there were more cells than microbubbles in the medium <ref type="bibr" coords="4,218.77,427.64,61.74,8.76;4,53.40,439.71,21.47,8.76" target="#b9">(Guzman et al. 2003)</ref>. As such, the sonoporated cells in our investigations can generally be assumed to remain viable immediately after exposure (this is an essential experimental control condition for our intended demonstration of sonoporation-induced cellular stress). Note that in our experimental trials, most of the microbubbles were found to have collapsed after exposure (deduced from empirical observations of the chamber well under a bright-field microscope). This suggests that acoustic cavitation (most likely inertial cavitation) had taken place over the exposure period as necessary to facilitate sonoporation. To obtain comparative evidence for such an assertion, a subset of experiments were conducted without adding microbubbles to the medium to determine the cellular impact of mere ultrasound exposure with our specified acoustic settings.</p></div>

This marker, with a molecular weight of 623 Da and molecular radius of 0.65 nm, would normally remain in the extracellular environment unless the cell membrane became permeabilized, as would be the case with sonoporation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,384.38,126.10,90.73,8.76" target="#b10">(Guzman et al. 2002)</ref>.

We focused particularly on the dynamics of the plasma membrane and intra-cellular lipids. To facilitate this investigation, 8.2 mM FM 4-64 membrane-sensitive fluorescence dye (T3166, Invitrogen; absorption FWHM: 445-565 nm; emission FWHM: 660-815 nm) was loaded onto the cells 1 h before adding calcein and microbubbles. The cells were then exposed to ultrasound using the platform described earlier. Immediately after ultrasound exposure, extracellular calcein was removed by washing with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1% fetal bovine serum (replaced with fresh culture medium afterward). The cells were then reincubated for 2 h to foster recovery. After that, they were fixed by adding 4% formaldehyde into the chamber well for 15 min, and their nuclei were stained with 6.5 mM 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence dye (DAPI; D1306, Invitrogen; absorption FWHM: 320-388 nm; emission FWHM: 420-512 nm) for 10 min (they were washed with PBS afterward). Subsequently, confocal images of these fixed cells were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 710; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 633 objective lens (pixel dwell time was set at 12.6 ms). Given the absorption and emission FWHM of the three fluorescent dyes, the following excitation wavelengths were used: 543 nm (FM 4-64), 350 nm (DAPI) and 488 nm (calcein); the corresponding detection bands were 650-730 nm (FM 4-64), 430-480 nm (DAPI) and 500-550 nm (calcein).</p><p>From the confocal images, the intra-cellular lipid level of sonoporated cells was quantified using built-in functions in the ZEN software (Carl Zeiss), and these were compared against those in the sham exposure group. Cellular cross-sectional area was also quantitatively analyzed based on bright-field images acquired with the same instrument. The means and standard errors of these measurements were computed in each population sample (based on a count size of .100 cells, repeated for three different trials). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed between exposure groups to identify statistically significant differences.</p></div>

The post-exposure developmental trend of sonoporated cells was quantitatively analyzed using flow cytometry. In particular, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis kinetics of these cells was evaluated using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) marker, which binds to cells in the synthesis phase (S phase) of the cell cycle. For this part of the investigation, pre-exposure cells (prior to addition of calcein and microbubbles) were first pulsed with 10 mM BrdU markers (550891; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 30 min to label cells that were in S phase at that time. Unbound BrdU was removed by washing the cells with warm complete culture medium, after which the cells were exposed to ultrasound based on the protocol described earlier. Cells were taken out of the chamber immediately after exposure and were washed with PBS (containing 1% fetal bovine serum) to remove extracellular calcein. Subsequently, they were transferred to a round culture dish (430167; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) for reincubation within a 37 C, 5% CO 2 environment.</p><p>Sorting of viable sonoporated cells. At three postexposure time points (0, 3 and 6 h), cells were extracted for flow cytometry analysis (5 3 10 6 cells were harvested for each experimental run). Non-viable cells were first labeled using 75 mM propidium iodide (PI) (P4170, Sigma-Aldrich; absorption maximum: 488 nm; emission maximum: 630 nm), which was added 15 min before performing flow cytometry. After that, bivariate Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,93.77,655.73,3.36,7.88">2</ref>. Flow cytometry analysis of sonicated cells performed 3 h after exposure. Data for sham controls are provided in columns 1 and 3, respectively, for ZR-75-30 and HL-60 cells. Results of sonication are given in columns 2 and 4 for the two cell types (1-MHz frequency, 1-kHz PRF, 100-cycle pulse length, 0.45-MPa spatially averaged peak negative pressure, 60-s duration, 10:1 cell:bubble ratio). In row 1 are bivariate plots of the distributions of cells that are viable (stained by PI) and sonoporated (calcein uptake). In rows 2 and 3, respectively, are the forwardscatter and sidescatter distributions of viable unsonoporated (black) and sonoporated cells (green).</p><p>calcein/PI fluorescence analysis of the cells was carried out in a flow cytometer (FACSAriaa III, BD Biosciences) that sorted cells at the rate of 3000 events/s (excitation wavelength was 488 nm for both markers, whereas detection bands were 616 6 23 and 530 6 30 nm, respectively, for PI and calcein). This served to extract sonoporated cells that remained viable after exposure for further analysis of their DNA synthesis kinetics with BrdU flow cytometry. As shown in row 1 of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,81.65,174.41,4.98,8.76">2</ref> (see columns 2 and 4), for both cell types, viable sonoporated cells (i.e., calcein positive and PI negative) accounted for between 45 and 50% of the sonicated cell population. Their forward-scatter (FSC) and sidescatter (SSC) distributions were analyzed to obtain supplementary evidence respectively on cell size and cellular granularity.</p><p>Analysis of BrdU-labeled sonoporated cells. The DNA synthesis kinetics of viable sonoporated cells was investigated using the BrdU/DNA flow cytometry analysis technique <ref type="bibr" coords="6,116.00,302.86,75.05,8.76" target="#b0">(Begg et al. 1985)</ref>. In carrying out this task, the sorted cells were first fixed with ice-cold ethanol and stored at 220 C overnight, after which they were centrifuged to remove supernatants and washed with PBS. Cell sample DNA was partially denatured by incubating the cells with 2 M hydrogen chloride for 20 min at room temperature (washed three times afterward with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 surfactants). Next, BrdU-positive cells (i.e., S-phase cells just before exposure) were fluorescently labeled by incubating the cells first with 100 mL of 1:50 anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (555627, BD Biosciences) for 1 h and then with 100 mL of 1:100 Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (A21235, Invitrogen; absorption maximum: 650 nm; emission maximum: 668 nm) for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently, the cells were stained with PI for 15 min to label their DNA contents (note that the cells were PI negative before fixation, and that this latter PI staining was for labeling of the fixed cells' DNA rather than identification of non-viable cells). After that, BrdU/DNA bivariate scatter plots of these cells were obtained using the flow cytometer to facilitate time-course analysis of DNA synthesis for viable sonoporated cells that were in S phase just before ultrasound exposure. An excitation wavelength of 633 nm and a detection band of 660 6 20 nm were used for fluorescence activation of BrdU-positive cells (same parameters as before were used for PI). From these plots, the temporal progression of DNA synthesis of BrdU-positive cells was examined, and DNA synthesis time was estimated using the relative movement extrapolation method as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" coords="6,99.90,676.49,82.99,8.76" target="#b0">(Begg et al. 1985)</ref>. Inter-group statistics (with N 5 4) were then compared using the Student's t-test to identify significant differences.</p></div>

Confocal microscopy images corresponding to this finding are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,374.80,156.50,4.98,8.76" target="#fig_1">3</ref> for ZR-75-30 attached cells. As can be observed, one distinct morphological feature of sonoporated cells (i.e., calcein positive; see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,489.32,180.59,8.50,8.76" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>) is that they seem to have shrunk in size. Indeed, rounding of both membrane and cell nucleus is evident as a result of sonoporation. It is worth noting that post-exposure membrane resealing likely took place in these sonoporated cells, as their plasma membrane (labeled with FM 4-64) were found to be intact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="6,304.43,278.12,180.15,8.55">Size reduction observed in sonoporated cells</head><p>Likely as a consequence of the post-exposure membrane shrinkage phenomenon, sonoporated cells were found to be smaller 2 h after exposure. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,522.13,314.13,9.44,8.76" target="#fig_2">4a</ref> illustrates a statistical analysis of cellular cross-sectional area for different cell groups. There is a significant decrease in the average size of sonoporated cells (61% decrease in cross-sectional area). This is consistent with the flow cytometry results shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,487.50,374.39,4.98,8.76">2</ref> (see row 2, columns 1 and 2) that depicted a drop in the viable sonoporated cells' FSC distribution, which is typical of a cell size decrease. Note that a post-exposure reduction in cell size may also be observed to a lesser extent for unsonoporated cells that were sonicated in the presence of microbubbles (i.e., cells in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,437.79,446.72,7.89,8.76" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>). This suggests that even though membrane permeation was not realized on these cells, the cavitational force resulting from ultrasound-microbubble interactions may still be substantial enough to induce stress on cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="6,304.45,520.10,179.96,8.55">Lipid accumulation within sonoporated cells</head><p>Another noteworthy morphological feature of sonoporated cells is their increased intra-cellular lipid level. As evidenced by the higher FM 4-64 fluorescence within the cellular membrane (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,472.14,568.19,7.63,8.76" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>), sonoporation gives rise to an accumulation of lipids in the cytoplasm that appear vacuolar-like. This is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,333.48,604.35,7.95,8.76" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, which shows that sonoporated cells exhibited a rise in intra-cellular FM 4-64 fluorescence (381% higher than that of sham control cells). It is in line with the flow cytometry plots in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,484.23,640.51,4.98,8.76">2</ref> (see row 3, columns 1 and 2) that showed an increase in the sonoporated cells' SSC distribution as reflective of a rise in cellular granularity. Note that the lipids accumulated within the cytoplasm and not at the membrane interface. Hence, this phenomenon is unlikely to be connected to membrane resealing that should have already taken place seconds after exposure. Instead, it may be indicative of a disruption to the normal course of intra-cellular lipid metabolism.</p></div>

As noted from these images, sonoporated HL-60 cells exhibited both membrane shrinkage and intra-cellular lipid accumulation. This is supported by the quantitative measurements shown in Figures 4b and 5b that showed a 50% reduction in sonoporated cell size and a 231% increase in intra-cellular FM 4-64 fluorescence level, respectively.

This can be noted by observing that  in the DNA histograms of these cells (rows 2 and 4), in comparison to those for sham exposure (rows 1 and 3), there is a slower temporal shift toward the right peak, the magnitude of which reflects the number of cells that had completed DNA synthesis and entered the G 2 /M (gap 2 or mitosis) phase of the cell cycle. In a related observation, according to the DNA histograms, at 6 h after exposure (right column of Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,269.68,596.44,3.60,8.76" target="#fig_5">7</ref>), a significantly smaller fraction of BrdU-positive sonoporated cells had completed their mitosis and returned to the G 0 /G 1 (gap 0 or gap 1) phase of the cell cycle. This is reflected by the smaller left peak in the DNA histograms of BrdU-positive sonoporated cells. On average, as plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,96.04,668.78,9.44,8.76" target="#fig_7">8a</ref> for ZR-75-30 cells, only 4.3% of BrdUpositive sonoporated cells were in the post-mitotic phase 6 h after exposure (as compared with 17.6% of BrdUpositive sham -exposed cells).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="10,53.40,361.93,129.34,8.55">Integrated perspective of results</head><p>In considering sonoporation as a membrane permeation strategy for drug/gene delivery applications, its biological aspects have often been overlooked. In this work, we sought to address this knowledge gap by investigating the morphological characteristics and developmental kinetics of sonoporated cells with enhanced exogenous molecule uptake (calcein fluorescence markers in our case). Through confocal microscopy observations and flow cytometry assays, we generally found that sonoporation, although capable of facilitating internalization of exogenous molecules, may inadvertently elicit a cellular stress response.</p><p>One indication of sonoporation-induced cellular stress is the emergence of repressive morphological characteristics presumably after membrane resealing occurred. In particular, over a multi-hour time frame (2 h in our study), sonoporated cells would exhibit membrane shrinkage and intra-cellular accumulation of lipids (Figs. <ref type="figure" coords="10,359.44,325.57,4.15,8.76" target="#fig_1">3</ref><ref type="figure" coords="10,363.59,325.57,4.15,8.76" target="#fig_2">4</ref><ref type="figure" coords="10,363.59,325.57,4.15,8.76" target="#fig_3">5</ref><ref type="figure" coords="10,367.74,325.57,4.15,8.76" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).

On further analysis of sonoporated cells using flow cytometry, we found that these cells are indeed under stress from the perspective of cellular development. Specifically, our BrdU cell cycle progression assay revealed that the pace at which sonoporated cells progress through cell cycle was significantly hindered (Figs. <ref type="figure" coords="11,77.90,186.48,4.98,8.76" target="#fig_5">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="11,100.58,186.48,3.58,8.76" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).

To further understand the factors limiting sonoporation efficiency, it would be of interest to connect the stress response observed in this study and the cellular mechanism of membrane structural changes in sonoporation. One particular follow-up investigation that is worth pursuing is determining how sonoporation-induced transmembranous trafficking of bioelectrical ions (not limited to Ca 21 influx) and liposomal vesicles (hypothesized to play an active role in membrane resealing) would contribute to instigation of a cellular stress response. Establishing this mechanistic connection would provide a more detailed account of the sequence of biological events involved in sonoporation.</p><p>In addition to their relevance to the optimization of sonoporation-mediated drug/gene delivery, our experimental findings may provide new perspectives on the therapeutic potential of sonoporation. For instance, one possible direction that may be explored is the development of new sonoporation-mediated treatment paradigms involving intentional induction of cellular injury with emphasis on temporarily halting cellular development. Inhibition of cancerous cell growth would be one potential application fitting into this treatment strategy. It can likely be combined with the delivery of anti-cancer drugs to take advantage of the increased membrane permeability facilitated by sonoporation (note that the feasibility of sonoporation-enhanced anti-cancer drug uptake has already been confirmed <ref type="bibr" coords="11,168.48,692.84,82.75,8.76" target="#b21">[Matsuo et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,254.44,692.84,26.02,8.76;11,53.40,704.91,47.13,8.76" target="#b29">Sasaki et al. 2012]</ref>).

Although much effort has been devoted to realizing this biophysical phenomenon through innovations in microbubble design and physical analysis of ultrasound dosages, a fundamental understanding of its associated cellular response remains to be established. The findings reported here, namely, those on the morphological response and developmental kinetics of sonoporated cells, essentially represent new insight into how sonoporation may stress cells even though their viability remains unaffected. Our findings were obtained under in vitro settings, and thus it would be worthwhile to extend this investigation to in vivo scenarios to more directly evaluate the repressive impact of sonoporation in practical applications. From a biophysical standpoint, additional studies are also needed to correlate the details of acoustic cavitation (e.g., type, magnitude) with the induction of repressive characteristics in sonoporated cells. We anticipate that with enriched efforts in investigating the biological aspects of sonoporation, proper cytoprotection strategies may be developed to reinforce the efficacy of sonoporation-mediated drug/gene delivery; in addition, further innovations in sonoporation-based treatment applications may be formulated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,77.27,326.34,430.36,7.88;3,77.27,336.32,430.35,7.88;3,77.27,346.24,430.36,7.88;3,77.27,355.43,430.38,8.97;3,77.27,366.20,430.36,7.88;3,196.89,376.11,191.16,7.88;3,64.69,65.77,455.73,251.55"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
