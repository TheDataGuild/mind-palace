<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The perforation of plasma membrane by ultrasound-driven microbubbles (i.e., sonoporation) provides a temporary window for transporting macromolecules into the cytoplasm that is promising with respect to drug delivery and gene therapy. To improve the efficacy of delivery while ensuring biosafety, membrane resealing and cell recovery are required to help sonoporated cells defy membrane injury and regain their normal function. Blebs are found to accompany the recovery of sonoporated cells. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of blebs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. With a customized platform for ultrasound exposure and 2-D/3-D live single-cell imaging, localized membrane perforation was induced with ultrasound-driven microbubbles, and the cellular responses were monitored using multiple fluorescent probes. The results indicated that localized blebs undergoing four phases (nucleation, expansion, pausing and retraction) on a time scale of tens of seconds to minutes were specifically involved in the reversibly sonoporated cells. The blebs spatially correlated with the membrane perforation site and temporally lagged (about tens of seconds to minutes) the resealing of perforated membrane. Their diameter (about several microns) and lifetime (about tens of seconds to minutes) positively correlated with the degree of sonoporation. Further studies revealed that intracellular calcium transients might be an upstream signal for triggering blebbing nucleation; exocytotic lysosomes not only contributed to resealing of the perforated membrane, but also to the increasing bleb volume during expansion; and actin components accumulation facilitated bleb retraction. These results provide new insight into the shortterm strategies that the sonoporated cell employs to recover on membrane perforation and to remodel membrane structure and a biophysical foundation for sonoporation-based therapy.</p></div>

On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that dynamic blebbing may be involved in the recovery of the sonoporated cells. To test this hypothesis, the aim of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of and mechanism underlying blebs in sonoporated cells and its relationship with reversible sonoporation by ultrasound-driven microbubbles.</p><p>We established an experimental platform for ultrasound exposure and real-time microscopic imaging at the single-cell level. Localized membrane perforation was induced by a single cavitating microbubble and different fluorescence probes were used to visualize membrane perforation, activities of the lipid components and spatiotemporal changes of lysosomes and the actin cytoskeleton. We then statistically determined the spatiotemporal relationship between blebs and the sonoporated cell and the underlying mechanism responsible for the spatiotemporal dynamics of bleb.</p></div>

As a representative example, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,522.71,675.48,9.33,8.74" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> illustrates the spatiotemporal dynamics of blebbing in sonoporated cells. At 0 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,429.79,699.34,7.48,8.74" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), a single microbubble was adjacent to cell 1, and no microbubble was around cell 2. After the microbubble rapidly collapsed with the 13.33-ms ultrasonic pulse, notable red fluorescence was observed at the site of the microbubble (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="7,228.13,101.63,8.44,8.74" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>; 6 s), indicating that the membrane was perforated and that extracellular PI diffused into cytoplasm.

However, after »120 s, the intracellular red fluorescence remained at a stable level, suggesting that extracellular PI stopped entering the cytoplasm and that the perforated membrane had completely resealed. The time profile of the relative intracellular PI intensity in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,81.24,233.10,9.33,8.74" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> exhibited the same temporal trend.

A small area at the initial site of the microbubble rapidly protruded upon membrane perforation, indicative of bleb nucleation, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,133.96,388.55,9.39,8.74" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> (6 s). The surface area of this protrusion gradually increased in the next 12À42 s, eventually forming a quasi-hemispherical protrusion (i.e., a bleb) approximately 4.62 mm in diameter.

A bright green fluorescent circular contour was observed at different positions along the z-axis. With increasing distance from the zero position on the z-axis (from 0 to §6.4 mm), the diameter of the green fluorescent ring in the xÀy section gradually decreased until the ring disappeared; this corresponded to the shape change of the bleb along the zaxis.

Note that because of the change in cellular mechanical properties, CD can induce bleb formation without membrane injury in a concentration-dependent manner. Generally, CD-induced blebs occurred at many sites of the cell membrane. They rapidly retracted under low-concentration CD while most of them maintained a relatively stable volume under high-concentration CD (data not shown). As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,368.62,639.59,9.91,8.74" target="#fig_7">8b</ref> (0 s), CD induced blebs located at the bottom of the overlap between cells 2 and 3 and on the body of cell 2 (some protrusions).

However, the occurrence of the localized blebs without retraction (type B) increased to »5% and »20% at CD concentrations of 300 and 1000 nM, respectively. In particular, when the concentration of CD used was 2500 nM, the probability of localized blebs significantly decreased to »7% (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, almost all of these blebs did not retract (type B). These results suggest that the actin components play a crucial role in bleb retraction.</p></div>

After the blebs maintained their morphology for a relatively short time (tens of seconds to minutes), they slowly retracted and completely disappeared. Although the site of the blebs spatially coincided with those of the membrane perforation, the four successive dynamic phases (nucleation, expansion, pausing and retraction) differed temporally from membrane perforation and resealing. Specifically, bleb nucleation and expansion occurred synchronously with membrane perforation and initially resealing, respectively (the duration of expansion was shorter than the time of extracellular PI uptake). However, the retraction phases lagged far behind membrane resealing. Thus, the lifetime of dynamic blebs (from nucleation to disappearance) was far longer than the time required for membrane resealing, meaning that blebbing and membrane resealing may be two parallel biological processes. In contrast, in the irreversibly sonoporated cells, even though larger, stable localized blebs occur at the initial sites of cavitating microbubbles, more secondary blebs randomly distribute around the membrane.

Further, early studies, which used laser ablation, micropipette aspiration and streptolysin O, determined that blebs generally occur at the cell surface where the plasma membrane detaches from the underlying cytoskeleton or in regions where the cytoskeleton exhibits local weaknesses (the bleb membrane is not supported by a cortex actin) <ref type="bibr" coords="15,448.21,245.06,83.81,8.74">(Charras et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,304.50,257.02,73.72,8.74" target="#b28">Keyel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,381.66,257.02,88.76,8.74" target="#b39">Paluch and Raz 2013)</ref>.

First, lysosome vesicles are rapidly delivered to the perforation site via exocytosis and then undergo homotypic fusion to patch and reseal the perforated membrane.

Subsequently, based on the previous studies, we think myosin-driven contraction mediated bleb retraction, which was slower than expansion. Moreover, when the function of actin was inhibited by CD, the probability of localized blebs in the reversibly sonoporated cells decreases with increasing concentration of CD. Furthermore, the blebs have defects in retraction with increase in CD concentration, indicating the role of the actin components in bleb retraction.

On the one hand, cells may need blebs to compensate for the drop in intracellular tension on perforation. On the other hand, blebs are often a harbinger of cell death, because they always appear in the membrane periphery of apoptotic cells <ref type="bibr" coords="16,53.01,699.34,93.24,8.74" target="#b2">(Babiychuk et al. 2011)</ref>. In mechanically wounded cells, blebbing has been identified as an injury-control mechanism when cells need to create subcellular compartments in which repair can take place <ref type="bibr" coords="16,432.39,89.67,95.35,8.74" target="#b2">(Babiychuk et al. 2011)</ref>. The surge of intracellular calcium transients leads to localized annexin A1 translocation to the bleb membrane and the formation of a plug, which creates a subcellular compartment in which resealing takes place <ref type="bibr" coords="16,304.50,149.42,97.04,8.74" target="#b2">(Babiychuk et al. 2011)</ref>. Thus, blebs represent a cell's attempt to escape death rather than a mechanism for promoting it. Consistent with this, our observations of localized blebs during resealing suggest that the sonoporated cell needs not only to reseal the perforated membrane to avoid intracellular contents lost, but also to initiate the nucleation and expansion of blebs for membrane remodeling. Moreover, the retraction of blebs is slower than membrane resealing. Therefore, we propose that cells are first repaired, followed by rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and remodeling of the membrane morphology to restore physiologic function. Our results also illustrated that sonoporated cells with localized reversible blebs can maintain their viability, whereas larger, stable blebs generally appear with irreversibly sonoporated cells. Therefore, dynamic (i.e., not stable) blebbing with four phases should be required for remodeling the plasma membrane and restoring physiologic function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="16,304.50,376.59,93.68,8.74">Limitations of the study</head><p>First, the HeLa cell line, as a tumor model, could provide the basic mechanism and kinetics of the blebs, which appear remarkably similar in many cell types and conditions. Moreover, to remain consistent with other studies in our group, HeLa cells were used in this investigation. However, endothelial cells are more physiologically relevant when the microbubbles flow through the blood vessels, and they are also another candidate for sonoporation in vivo. Future studies should select them as a model to further confirm the bleb dynamics and the related mechanisms. Second, although we assumed all reversibly sonoporated cells should undergo bleb formation, in our statistics, the blebs with four phases appeared in »55% of the reversibly sonoporated cells. We think there are some possible reasons for this. On the one hand, the observable blebs were always related to the initial position of the microbubbles. When microbubbles were located at the lateral contour of the cell, the localized blebs with four phases were likely to be observed. Additionally, some localized blebs that may occur at the position of the cell body (because the initial microbubbles are located at the cell body) expand and retract along z-axis direction, resulting in their being difficult to be observed when imaging along the xÀy plane. On the other hand, it was difficult to image some smaller blebs with fast expansion and retraction using a system with limited scanning speed. Third, there was no flow in the experimental setup, so microbubbles were attached to cells, which is not the case in vivo. In designing an experimental setup with flowing microbubbles it is important to reveal the cellular bio-effects on the ultrasound-driven microbubbles in vivo. Finally, the responses of the sonoporated cells in this study are for only one set of ultrasound parameters and a type of cavitation. Future studies should design multiple types of cavitation to determine the correlation between the acoustic emissions and blebbing characterization. These results would provide solid foundation for future sonoporation-based therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="17,130.39,226.35,72.80,8.74">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Dynamic blebs were found to be specifically associated with the reversibly sonoporated cells. These blebs occurred at the site of perforation, and their maximal diameter (about several microns) and lifetime (about tens of seconds to minutes) positively correlated with the degree of membrane perforation; these blebs persisted beyond the time required to reseal the membrane (about tens of seconds to minutes). By contrast, larger, stable blebs appeared in the irreversibly sonoporated cells. Our preliminary investigation also revealed that intracellular calcium transients, lysosome exocytosis,\ and the accumulation of actin components mediate the nucleation, expansion, pausing and retraction phases of the dynamic blebs. We believe that these dynamic blebs may be necessary to restore the membrane structure and function of cells after sonoporation. These will provide the theoretical basis for clinical application of sonoporation-based macromolecule delivery.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,75.69,406.17,433.66,7.86;4,75.69,416.14,433.60,7.86;4,75.69,426.12,433.66,7.86;4,75.69,436.04,433.69,7.86;4,75.69,446.02,433.66,7.86;4,135.38,456.00,314.32,7.86;4,60.66,63.38,463.92,330.90"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
