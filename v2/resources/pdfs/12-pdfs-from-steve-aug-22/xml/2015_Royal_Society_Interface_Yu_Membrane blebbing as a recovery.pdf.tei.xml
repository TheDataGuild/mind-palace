<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Site-specific perforation of the plasma membrane can be achieved through ultrasound-triggered cavitation of a single microbubble positioned adjacent to the cell. However, for this perforation approach (sonoporation), the recovery manoeuvres invoked by the cell are unknown. Here, we report new findings on how membrane blebbing can be a recovery manoeuvre that may take place in sonoporation episodes whose pores are of micrometres in diameter. Each sonoporation site was created using a protocol involving single-shot ultrasound exposure (frequency: 1 MHz; pulse length: 30 cycles; peak negative pressure: 0.45 MPa) which triggered inertial cavitation of a single targeted microbubble (diameter: 1-5 mm). Over this process, live confocal microscopy was conducted in situ to monitor membrane dynamics, model drug uptake kinetics and cytoplasmic calcium ion (Ca 2þ ) distribution. Results show that blebbing would occur at a recovering sonoporation site after its resealing, and it may emerge elsewhere along the membrane periphery. The bleb size was correlated with the pre-exposure microbubble diameter, and 99% of blebbing cases at sonoporation sites were inflicted by microbubbles larger than 1.5 mm diameter (analysed over 124 sonoporation episodes). Blebs were not observed at irreversible sonoporation sites or when sonoporation site repair was inhibited via extracellular Ca 2þ chelation. Functionally, the bleb volume was found to serve as a buffer compartment to accommodate the cytoplasmic Ca 2þ excess brought about by Ca 2þ influx during sonoporation. These findings suggest that membrane blebbing would help sonoporated cells restore homeostasis.</p></div>

All rights reserved.</p><p>Alas, amid the technical advances in targeted microbubble design that enabled controlled instigation of sonoporation, the biophysical details involved in this process have remained vaguely understood. At issue is the lack of knowledge on how a cell seeks to recover from sonoporation episodes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,101.64,102.26,14.14,9.10" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.79,102.26,10.61,9.10" target="#b20">20]</ref>, especially those that were triggered locally by the cavitation of microbubbles bordering the plasma membrane. This issue is after all of crucial relevance to the survival of sonoporated cells. Previous findings have reported instances of membrane morphology alterations in cells that were subjected to acoustic cavitation exposure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,174.26,28.45,9.10">[21 -24]</ref>, but the constitutive processes leading to these alterations have yet to be identified. Perhaps two recovery manoeuvres that may take place during sonoporation are endocytosis-mediated membrane reunion and exocytosismediated vesicular patching <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.33,222.27,13.64,9.10" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. The former is suggested to be applicable to nanometre-sized pores <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.46,234.29,13.68,9.10" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, while the latter is often invoked in cases with acute calcium ion (Ca 2þ ) influx <ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.39,258.28,13.64,9.10" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, which would indeed arise during sonoporation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.52,270.30,14.14,9.10" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,56.66,270.30,10.61,9.10" target="#b29">29]</ref>. However, the caveat in solely relying on these two manoeuvres to underscore the recovery phase of sonoporation is that they cannot serve to explain why significant membrane protrusions were observed in some sonoporated cells <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.37,306.30,13.68,9.10" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. As such, it is conceivable that other forms of morphological remodelling events would take place as a sonoporated cell seeks to repair the cavitation-induced physical discontinuities on its plasma membrane.</p><p>In this article, we report new insights into the recovery dynamics in sonoporation by demonstrating membrane blebbing as a possible action in which a sonoporated cell may undertake in its stride to restore plasma membrane integrity. Specifically, our investigation has sought to establish the causality between: (i) individual, site-specific sonoporation episodes induced by ultrasound-triggered collapse of a single targeted microbubble (a terminal feature of inertial cavitation) attached to the plasma membrane and (ii) emergence of blebs at the recovering sonoporation site and at other parts of the plasma membrane. In hypothesizing that blebbing is a sonoporation-related membrane remodelling event, our rationale was twofold. First, as blebs are essentially local herniations on the membrane <ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.71,522.29,13.99,9.10" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,129.71,522.29,10.50,9.10" target="#b31">31]</ref>, they are seemingly in close resemblance to the protrusive membrane blisters observed in some sonoporated cells <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.47,546.27,13.50,9.10" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Second, it is recognized that acute disruption of the actin cytoskeleton would favour bleb formation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,74.21,570.25,13.46,9.10" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, and such disruption would indeed take place during microbubble-mediated sonoporation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.43,582.27,13.50,9.10" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Taken together, it is plausible that blebbing may occur as a reactionary manoeuvre in sonoporation episodes, particularly since reparable sonoporation sites can be a few micrometres in size <ref type="bibr" coords="2,268.79,618.27,14.79,9.10" target="#b34">[34]</ref> and passive membrane reunion is known to falter under this circumstance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,96.61,642.25,13.46,9.10" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Note that, from a cell biology standpoint, blebbing has conventionally been associated with cell locomotion and cell death <ref type="bibr" coords="2,143.72,666.29,12.03,9.10" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.75,666.29,4.01,9.10" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.76,666.29,12.03,9.10" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, but recent evidence has shown that this manoeuvre is equally important in helping wounded cells avoid immediate lysis when they were nonspecifically attacked by pore-forming toxins <ref type="bibr" coords="2,218.16,702.29,13.51,9.10" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Taking into account the latter notion, we surmise that observing a similar phenomenon in sonoporation is after all not peculiar. Indeed, our current investigation would serve to substantiate the prorecovery nature of membrane blebbing by providing novel direct observations of bleb formation at recovering membrane wounds that were physically instigated on a site-specific basis via sonoporation.</p></div>

For this task, we have made use of a customized confocal imaging platform that was assembled recently for another study on sonoporation-induced actin network disruption <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.93,134.54,12.78,8.59" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. As shown in figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,450.95,134.54,3.19,8.59" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the ultrasound exposure apparatus of our experimental platform comprised a cascade of waveform generator (33120A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), broadband amplifier (50 dB gain; 2100L, Electronics and Innovation Ltd, Rochester, NY, USA) and a single-element unfocused piston transducer (1 MHz centre frequency, 25.4 mm effective diameter; Wuxi Beisheng Technology Ltd, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China). Ultrasound pulses emitted from the ultrasound exposure apparatus were passed into a leg-shaped acrylic waveguide that served as a collimating device (1.5 mm wall thickness, 70 mm leg length, 408 leg angle), and the collimated pulses were in turn emitted through the waveguide's cuboid foot base. Placed in contact with the waveguide base was a cassette-shaped cell chamber, whose bottom interface was an acoustically thin glass coverslip (0.13 mm thick) with an enumerated grid (1 Â 1 mm box resolution) as a guide for in situ tracking of cell location. During experimentation, cell morphology was observed live using a confocal fluorescence microscopy system (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and a 40Â oil immersion lens (420461-9910, Carl Zeiss).</p></div>

The applied pulse was a 30-cycle tone burst with 1 MHz wave frequency (i.e. 30 ms pulse duration). As calibrated previously through hydrophone mapping <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.60,420.27,12.39,8.59" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, the collimated acoustic field emerging from the waveguide's cuboid foot was relatively homogeneous along the cell chamber coverslip's axial position (instead of following the typical free-field acoustic pressure profile that is marked by diffraction sidelobes). The acoustic peak negative pressure was measured to be 0.45 MPa in the microscope's field of view. At this pressure level, the targeted microbubbles that we introduced as localized sonoporation agents (details to be described later) would generally collapse for our given applied pulse. Correspondingly, the type of cavitational activity responsible for our sonoporation episodes should belong to the inertial cavitation regime in which jetting is known to occur <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.81,541.25,12.41,8.59" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.

This labelling procedure was done prior to ultrasound exposure and the introduction of microbubbles to the cell chamber.

In each experimental trial, the microbubbles were added to the cell chamber in mixture form (20 ml; 10 8 bubbles ml 21 concentration).

Briefly, the fabrication process involved: (i) creating a phospholipid film comprising DSPC (850365; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) and DSPE-PEG2000-biotin (880129; Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 95 : 5 molar ratio; (ii) infusing C 3 F 8 gas upon the surface of the hydrated phospholipid film and concurrently sonicating with a sonicator (Model 250, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA) that was equipped with a 3-mm probe head (cat. no. 101-063-212; Branson Ultrasonics); (iii) stepwise conjugating avidin (A887; Invitrogen) and biotinylated VEGF receptor antibodies (AHG9119; Invitrogen) at a 1 : 1 molar ratio onto the microbubble shell.

In terms of its properties, Sytox-Green, with excitation and emission maxima of 504 nm and 523 nm, respectively, is known to be cell impermeant unless the plasma membrane integrity is disrupted.

These wavelengths were used for fluorescence excitation: (i) CellMask Orange (for plasma membrane): 543 nm;</p><p>(ii) Sytox-Green (for sonoporation tracing) and Fluo4-AM (for intracellular Ca 2þ tracking): 488 nm. The detection bands used for the three fluorescent labels were, respectively, 565-640 nm (CellMask) and 495 -560 nm (Sytox and Fluo4-AM). Bright field images were taken concurrently to locate the microbubble position on the cell surface.</p><p>In each experimental trial, the confocal scan plane was set to the z-axis position that corresponded to the central cross-section of the cell monolayer. Thereafter, single-shot ultrasound exposure was delivered to the cell chamber, and the resulting membrane dynamics were monitored in situ. Depending on the fluorescent labelling applied to a particular sample, the model drug (Sytox) uptake kinetics or the intracellular Ca 2þ (Fluo4-AM) dynamics were also tracked concurrently. A pinhole size of 130 mm was used so that the slice thickness (4.6 mm) would encompass the bulk of the cell volume, and the pixel dwell time was set to 1.27 ms. In total, 124 episodes of site-specific sonoporation were imaged at a single-cell level.</p><p>In another set of 12 sonoporation episodes, detailed morphological insights were gained by conducting volumetric scanning of the plasma membrane. Specifically, a three-dimensional sweep of the membrane contour before exposure was first acquired by carrying out a series of xy-plane scans at different z-axis positions (with 2 mm z-axis step size) to cover the entire cell volume. A pinhole size of 63 mm was used for these scans, and it in turn yielded an effective xy-plane sectional thickness of 2 mm; the pixel dwell time was set to 2.55 ms. Their membrane dynamics during sonoporation were then tracked using the same imaging protocol as described above; note that, to maintain sufficient imaging frame rate, three-dimensional confocal scans were not conducted during this live monitoring process. At the end of the live observation period, another three-dimensional confocal sweep was conducted to obtain volumetric information about the post-sonoporation membrane morphology.</p></div>

In particular, the following parameters were measured using built-in functions in IMAGEJ: (i) pre-exposure microbubble diameter (based on bright-field signature); (ii) temporal-peak pore diameter (by measuring the gap length of membrane periphery disruption as highlighted by CellMask); (iii) bleb volume at the sonoporation site (from measuring the bleb size in the three-dimensional confocal image volume). Pearson correlation analysis was carried out on these measurements to assess the relationships between: (i) microbubble diameter and bleb volume (association between sonoporation and membrane blebbing); (ii) microbubble diameter and pore diameter (association between the instigation of sonoporation episodes and the size of sonoporation sites). In addition, using the 124 sonoporation episodes in which single-plane membrane dynamics data were available, we tallied the number of occurrences of sonoporation-induced blebbing for different microbubble size groups (eight groups spanning between 1 and 5 mm; each with 0.5 mm range). For this task, the overarching criterion used to classify blebbing is whether a sonoporated cell had exhibited one or more physical protrusions of the membrane periphery over the observation period. Each microbubble size group had at least 10 cells considered (N group ! 10).</p></div>

Second, over the course of time, the intra-bleb Ca 2þ level had seemingly dissipated at a rate similar to the cytoplasmic Ca 2þ level. In particular, Fluo4-AM fluorescence within the bleb and the cytoplasm had both decreased to the baseline level after 3 min (figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,177.34,359.48,10.34,9.10" target="#fig_4">6g,</ref><ref type="figure" coords="8,187.68,359.48,3.45,9.10">h</ref>). On the whole, these two observations indicate that, while the cell attempted to restore Ca 2þ homeostasis after sonoporation, the bleb had functionally served as a physical buffer zone to help the cell to accommodate the anomalous amount of Ca 2þ that had accumulated in the cytoplasm as a result of sonoporation-induced Ca 2þ influx.</p></div>

Sonoporation-induced membrane blebbing: summative recap</p><p>How cells strive to restore plasma membrane integrity in a sonoporation episode is an important question that has remained unanswered hitherto. While direct observations of sonoporation site closure have been reported <ref type="bibr" coords="8,247.36,558.30,13.64,9.10" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, the mechanistic steps involved in the process are still unknown with the exception of a few hypotheses based on site patching and membrane self-reunion arguments <ref type="bibr" coords="8,199.00,594.30,13.64,9.10" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. In this work, we have gained insight into the recovery dynamics in sonoporation episodes that were generated by inertial cavitation of targeted microbubbles. Central to our investigation is the use of a previously established experimental protocol that allowed us to identify the in situ position of sonoporation sites via the tracking of the pre-exposure targeted microbubble location <ref type="bibr" coords="8,75.80,678.31,13.50,9.10" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Using this protocol, a new series of direct observations has been acquired on possible membrane-level events that may take place at sonoporation sites after their resealing.</p><p>Results have generally illustrated that membrane blebbing in the form of physical herniations may emerge in the recovery phase of sonoporation episodes. At a single-cell level, a number of salient findings are worth highlighting in our experiments. First, blebbing was found to occur at the sonoporation site after its initial resealing, and it may also emerge at other places along the membrane periphery (Cells 1 to 3 in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,460.69,311.45,3.22,9.10">2</ref>). This morphological feature may well explain why physical protrusions may arise on the membrane of cells that were exposed to acoustic cavitation instigated on a non-specific basis <ref type="bibr" coords="8,498.28,347.45,13.68,9.10" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Another finding to be noted is that membrane blebbing was seemingly specific to sonoporation sites that could undergo successful repair, as irreversibly punctured sites (Cell 4 in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,504.01,395.47,3.70,9.10">2</ref>) and inhibition of sonoporation site repair via extracellular Ca 2þ chelation (electronic supplementary material, movie S2, and figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,338.68,431.48,3.70,9.10">3</ref>) had both suppressed bleb formation. Correspondingly, it can be inferred that blebbing is after all related to a cell's recovery manoeuvre during a sonoporation episode. In terms of the size of sonoporation-induced membrane blebs, which are essentially volumetric in nature (figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,543.12,479.49,3.22,9.10" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), it was generally found to be correlated with the size of the microbubble responsible for inflicting the sonoporation episode (figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,377.80,515.49,6.77,9.10" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>). Also, over 124 sonoporation episodes, most of the blebbing cases (99%) were seemingly inflicted by microbubbles larger than 1.5 mm diameter (table <ref type="table" coords="8,543.12,539.47,3.22,9.10" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). This trend suggests that blebbing is more likely to form at large sonoporation sites (up to 6.8 mm pore diameter in our experiments; figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,391.35,575.47,6.88,9.10" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>).</p></div>

From a biophysical perspective, this phenomenon may be attributed to two factors. The first pertains to the cytostructural dynamics of a sonoporated cell. It is known that, when sonoporation is instigated, there is concomitant rupturing of the actin cytoskeleton network that is physically interconnected with the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" coords="8,535.70,726.33,13.64,9.10" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Although membrane integrity may be restored within tens of seconds, actin disassembly may persist, and this would promote an increase in the local hydrostatic pressure because of the resulting sparser cytoskeleton scaffold <ref type="bibr" coords="8,490.68,774.29,12.95,9.10" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,503.63,774.29,4.32,9.10" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,508.89,774.29,10.61,9.10" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Consequently, the membrane of the newly resealed sonoporation rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 12: 20150029 site would reactively be pinched outward in attempt to restore pressure equilibrium. Note that sonoporation-induced actin network disruption may not necessarily be a localized phenomenon and may propagate to the entire cell over time <ref type="bibr" coords="9,42.52,90.30,13.50,9.10" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. As such, it is not unreasonable to expect that secondary blebs may emerge at other places along a sonoporated cell's membrane periphery (i.e. away from the sonoporation site). We postulate that the second factor as to why sonoporationinduced membrane blebbing may take place is because of the activation of a cytoprotective response. As reported in the cell biology literature, blebbing is a manoeuvre that may help an injured cell resist against immediate lysis <ref type="bibr" coords="9,200.02,174.26,13.51,9.10" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Our experiments have suggested that the intra-bleb volume, which is essentially created through an outward pinching of the membrane, would fulfil such a cytoprotective function by physically serving as a buffer compartment to accommodate the high cytoplasmic Ca 2þ level brought about by the Ca 2þ influx during sonoporation (electronic supplementary material, movie S3, and figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,69.22,258.28,3.22,9.10" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). This Ca 2þ buffer zone functionality would persist while the sonoporated cell attempts to restore homeostasis by draining excessive Ca 2þ from the cytoplasm. Taken together with earlier findings that showed how transient disruption of membrane integrity via sonoporation may trigger cellular stress activation <ref type="bibr" coords="9,111.52,318.26,14.00,9.10" target="#b39">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,125.51,318.26,10.50,9.10" target="#b40">40]</ref>, one may deduce that blebbing is after all part of a sonoporated cell's anti-stress machinery.</p></div>

On the other hand, it is also worth investigating the course of recovery action involved in sonoporation episodes instigated by: (i) ultrasound-triggered cavitation of microbubbles that are positioned at a distance away from the plasma membrane and (ii) stable cavitation in which microbubble oscillation is the defining feature (rather than microbubble collapse as is the case in inertial cavitation). For these investigations, it is essential to make use of meticulous instruments to control the relative distance between the microbubble and the plasma membrane, such as optical tweezers <ref type="bibr" coords="9,225.30,540.27,30.10,9.10">[41 -43]</ref> or the combined use of laser optics and acoustic radiation force <ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.81,42.27,13.64,9.10" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. We hypothesize that, under both scenarios, blebbing at the sonoporation site may not necessarily occur because the cavitational impact that reached the plasma membrane would consequently be tapered. Instead, less rigorous manoeuvres may be triggered to restore cellular homeostasis.</p><p>On a related topic, it would be of interest to consider whether and how membrane recovery would take place in more intricate sonoporation scenarios. One particular case worth analysing is the scenario where concurrent induction of multiple sonoporation episodes would occur on the same cell via the cavitation of multiple microbubbles. An example of such case is that of Cell 4 depicted in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure 2. In this multi-site sonoporation example, membrane resealing did not occur, and the cell had seemingly become non-viable. To generalize such an observation, it would be beneficial to study the membrane impact of different parameters related to multi-site sonoporation, including the number, size and positioning of microbubbles attached to the cell. Doing so would render new insight on why the use of bubble-to-cell ratios greater than unity for sonoporation purposes has been shown to increase the chances of cell death <ref type="bibr" coords="9,444.82,294.27,13.64,9.10" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Note that the recovery dynamics of sonoporation may be different when using nontone-burst ultrasound pulsing waveforms, such as chirps <ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.81,330.27,13.64,9.10" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. It would be relevant to survey this issue as well.</p><p>A further avenue of investigation worth pursuing is to connect our observations with theoretical biophysics models that describe plasma membrane behaviour during ultrasound exposure <ref type="bibr" coords="9,352.80,378.29,14.14,9.10" target="#b47">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,366.94,378.29,10.61,9.10" target="#b48">48]</ref>. The pursuit of this foundational study would provide us with a more predictive account of the biophysical conditions under which blebbing would occur at sonoporation sites. In turn, it would create new knowledge on the mechanistic foundations of sonoporation. Such knowledge would be practically relevant to ongoing application development efforts that seek to leverage sonoporation to intentionally disrupt the plasma membrane for therapeutic purposes, such as the delivery of drugs and genes into cells.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,42.52,362.90,510.26,8.74;3,42.52,374.92,85.18,8.74;3,130.37,42.50,333.50,312.02"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
