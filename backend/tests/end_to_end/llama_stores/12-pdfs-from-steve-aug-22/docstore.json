However, there is a general lack of mechanistic knowledge on sonoporation-induced cellular impact after membrane resealing, and this issue has made it challenging to apply sonoporation efficiently in practice. Here, we present new evidence on how sonoporation, without endangering immediate cell viability, may disrupt downstream cellular hemostasis in ways that are distinguished from the bioeffects observed in other sonicated and unsonoporated cells. Sonoporation was realized on HL-60 leukemia cells by delivering pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz frequency, 0.50 MPa peak negative pressure; 10% duty cycle; 30 s exposure period; 29.1 J/cm 2 acoustic energy density) in the presence of lipid-shelled microbubbles (1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio). Results showed that 54.6% of sonoporated cells, despite remaining initially viable, underwent apoptosis or necrosis at 24 h after sonoporation. Anti-proliferation behavior was also observed in sonoporated cells as their subpopulation size was reduced by 43.8% over 24 h. Preceding these cytotoxic events, the percentages of sonoporated cells in different cell cycle phases were found to be altered by 12 h after exposure. As well, for sonoporated cells, their expressions of cytoprotective genes in the heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) family were upregulated by at least 4.1 fold at 3 h after exposure. Taken altogether, these findings indicate that sonoporated cells attempted to restore homeostasis after membrane resealing, but many of them ultimately failed to recover.

This membrane perforation paradigm often works by applying low-intensity ultrasound to microbubble situated near the cell membrane to create transient pores that in turn serve as physical windows for extracellular molecules to infiltrate target cells without inducing undesired thermal effects  6  . From a drug delivery standpoint, one major advantage of sonoporation is its high spatiotemporal specificity  7  . Accordingly, it has strong potential in facilitating precise, controlled release of drug payload to target cells. Alas, sonoporation-mediated drug delivery has yet to reach widespread clinical use, as the efficiency of this approach has been deemed to be mediocre  8  . Detailed understanding on sonoporation mechanisms has long been regarded as vital to determine how sonoporation may be efficiently realized without inducing unwanted confounding effects  9, 10  . On this topic, not only is it important to unravel the acute biophysical impact of sonoporation  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  , the downstream cellular bioeffects of sonoporation after membrane resealing also need to be accounted for  16  . Without such mechanistic understanding, pursuing rational use of sonoporation in biomedicine inherently becomes more challenging  8, 10, 16  . Although it is recognized that analyzing the downstream bioeffects of sonoporation is critical to enhance its practical efficiency, such analyses are not trivial to carry out properly from an experimental design standpoint. One known issue is that, when using ultrasound and microbubbles to induce sonoporation in a cell population, such exposure would lead to a heterogeneity of response among the sonicated cells  17, 18  . In particular, not all sonicated cells may undergo sonoporation, and some of them may instantly lose viability  17, 19  . Such heterogeneity, if neglected, fundamentally represents a significant confounding factor in the analysis of sonoporation-induced cellular bioeffects. Previously, without acknowledging the heterogeneity of cell response, some studies have shown that ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles may lead to cell lysis  20, 21  , apoptosis  22  , cell cycle arrest  23  , and morphological changes  24, 25  . Yet, it remains unclear as to whether these biological effects are specific to sonoporation or whether they are merely attributed to ultrasound exposure. In this paper, we present a new substantiated body of evidence on the downstream cellular impact of sonoporation by properly differentiating the bioeffects of viable sonoporated cells from other sonicated cells. The focus of our investigation is on analyzing sonoporated cells' post-resealing viability, proliferation trend, cell-cycle distribution, and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) expression level, the last of which is known to be upregulated when cells are stressed  26  . Such an analysis allows us to more precisely identify whether, after membrane resealing has taken place, sonoporation may induce cellular impact that could be cytoprotective or cytotoxic in nature. Here, we have sought to test the overall hypothesis that various downstream bioeffects of sonoporated cells, such as proliferation behavior and HSP-70 expression levels, are different from those for cells that merely received ultrasound exposure. We further hypothesized that, in sonoporated cells, alterations in cell proliferation kinetics and HSP-70 expressions may emerge hours after ultrasound exposure when membrane integrity has long been restored.

As illustrated in Fig.  1  and described in the Methods section, the protocol involves the use of a calibrated, immersion-based ultrasound exposure setup (1 MHz ultrasound frequency, 10% duty cycle, 0.50 MPa in-situ peak negative pressure, 30 s exposure period, 29.1 J/cm 2 acoustic energy density). Experiments were conducted using HL-60 leukemia cells (CCL240, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) as the cell model, because their pro-apoptotic protein deficiency  28  suitably acted as an experimental control in our investigation that included analysis of sonoporation-induced anti-proliferation effects  29  . Microbubbles (USphere Prime; Trust Biosonics, Hsinchu, Taiwan) were injected into the cell chamber at a 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio to serve as sonoporation agents. Such a cell-to-bubble ratio is known to efficiently trigger the onset of sonoporation without significantly inducing instant cell death  20  . As shown previously, our exposure protocol yielded an average sonoporation rate of 41.9% among sonicated HL-60 cells  27  . In this investigation, sonicated cells were re-incubated for 5 min after exposure to allow for membrane resealing to take place. Such post-exposure re-incubation period effectively took into consideration previous direct observations that showed how membrane resealing would typically happen within 1 min from the onset of a resealable sonoporation episode  11  . Afterward, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was carried out. Two subpopulations were accordingly isolated for cellular impact analysis: (i) viable sonoporated cells (SNP+ group); (ii) viable unsonoporated cells (SNP-group). To facilitate comparison, experiments were also conducted for: (i) a control cell group (CTL group) with sham exposure; (ii) a sonicated cell group (US group) that received exposure in the absence of microbubbles. As presented in the following subsections, our investigation has yielded a new, unique body of experimental insights on the downstream bioeffects that emerged in viable sonoporated cells (i.e. SNP+ group) at different post-resealing time points.  For the SNP+ group, significant emergence of dead cells, which may stem from late apoptosis or necrosis, was found over 24 h. Figure  2b  shows the trend of the percentage of dead cells in the four tested cell groups over 24 h after exposure. As can been observed, dead cells in the SNP+ group had a significantly higher population than those in the CTL group at 8 h (p < 0.05), 12 h (p < 0.001), and 24 h (p < 0.001). The average percentage of dead cells in the SNP+ group reached 28.8% at 12 h. The dead cell percentage subsequently dropped to 18.5% at 24 h after exposure because some dead cells, whether they originate from the apoptosis or necrosis pathways, had already been lysed by that time and could no longer be detected by flow cytometry. In contrast, the SNP-and US groups had dead cell percentages below 20% over 24 h. Both groups showed no significant difference in dead cells between them and with respect to the CTL group at 24 h. The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells in each group at different post-exposure time points is plotted in Fig.  2c . The data points were derived by summing the early apoptotic (Annexin-V + and PI-) and dead cell (PI +) populations. The primary observation to be noted is that for cells in the SNP+ group, over half of them failed to survive at 24 h after exposure (apoptotic and necrotic cells on average accounted for 54.6% of group population). Since some dead cells were already lysed and were thus not detectable after 24 h, the actual number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in the SNP+ group may be even higher than that reported in Fig.  2c . Note that the significant rise in the SNP+ group's apoptotic and necrotic cell subpopulation (p < 0.001) started to emerge at 12 h after exposure. In contrast, the average apoptotic and necrotic cell percentage in the SNP-group merely comprised 16.8% of the group population at 24 h after exposure. This trend is similar to that observed for the CTL and US groups. Viable sonoporated cells exhibited anti-proliferation behavior. Proliferation of cells in the SNP+ group was found to be halted over a 24-h post-exposure observation period. Figure  3  presents the normalized cell population of each group at 3, 8, 12 and 24 h after exposure as obtained from a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) bioassay. CTL, US and SNP-groups showed a rising trend in their population over 24 h, while the SNP+ group exhibited a substantial decrease in population. The population of CTL and US groups did not exhibit a statistically significant change from 3 to 8 h after exposure, whereas SNP+ and SNP-populations were decreased over the same period (p < 0.001 for SNP+ ; p < 0.01 for SNP-). Subsequently, at 12 h after exposure, the SNP-group by-and-large restored its population to the baseline level (with no statistically significant difference in comparison to the SNP-population at 3 h). In contrast, the SNP+ cells were still significantly lower than the initial population (p < 0.001). The low population of SNP+ persisted at 24 h after exposure, while the other three groups exhibited a population growth trend from 12 to 24 h. To quantify the differences in the proliferation trends of the four groups, we calculated the post-exposure proliferation rate as the ratio of the population at 24 h to the population at 3 h. As shown in Table  1 , the average proliferation rate of the CTL, US and SNP-cell groups were accordingly found to be 1.75, 2.12, and 1.31 respectively. In contrast, the average proliferation rate of the SNP+ group was estimated to be 0.56, which corresponds to an average population loss of 44% from 3 to 24 h. The population changes from 8 to 12 h (\u0394 1 ) and from 12 to 24 h (\u0394 2 ) were also calculated to evaluate the transient cell growth trend of each group. Results showed that over the period between 8 and 12 h, the SNP+ group population increased transiently by 60.1% on average (p < 0.001). Yet, this group's population did not continue its rising trend from 12 to 24 h, as no statistically significant difference was found between the SNP+ group populations at 12 h and 24 h (the 13.2% decrease stated in Table  1  only exhibited weak statistical difference; p < 0.1). This population trend is different from the growth trends for the CTL, US, and SNP-cell groups, all of which experienced a statistically significant population increase from 8 to 12 h and from 12 to 24 h.

The results of cell proliferation rates suggested differences in the cell division activities of the four groups of cells. To investigate the impact of the exposure on each phase of cell division, a time-lapse cell cycle analysis was conducted at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure via flow cytometry analysis of the cells' deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contents. This analysis focused on the subgroup size of three cell-cycle phases: (i) G 0 /G 1 phase (cells in quiescence or in preparation for DNA synthesis); (ii) S phase (cells undergoing DNA synthesis); (iii) G 2 /M phase (cells after completion of DNA synthesis but have not yet divided). For the four cell groups of interest, Fig.  4a-c  show the percentage of cells in the three phases as a function of post-exposure time.

In contrast, the SNP+ and SNP-groups had shown fluctuations in the cellcycle distribution from 8 h onward. Specifically, as highlighted in Fig.  4e , the percentage of S-phase cells in the SNP+ group decreased slightly at 8 h, and it further declined at 12 h (p < 0.001). In sync with the latter trend, at 12 h, there was a commensurate rise in the percentage of cells in the G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases (p < 0.01). At 24 h, in the SNP+ cell group, we observed respectively a persistent reduction and increase in the size of the S-phase and G 0 /G 1 -phase subgroups (p < 0.001), while the size of the G 2 /M-phase subgroup returned to the baseline level.

The cell-cycle disruption trends observed in the SNP+ and SNP-cell groups indicated that their subcellular stress signal expressions may be concomitantly altered over time. To investigate the potential downstream molecular bioeffects of ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles, we evaluated the post-exposure transcription levels of three HSP-70 genes (HSPA1A, HSPA1B and HSPA6) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. These three genes encode the key proteins of the HSP70 family, which play a cytoprotective role in a cell's protein folding machinery and is highly conserved in all organisms.

Sonoporation, despite being considered as a promising membrane perforation technique with strong application potential in drug/gene delivery, has not yet reached widespread clinical use largely because its mechanistic foundations are still not well characterized. Results from our investigation have allowed us to form new perspectives on the cellular impact of sonoporation by revealing how this membrane perforation approach, even whilst it may not affect the viability of target cells, may jeopardize post-exposure cellular homeostasis over a prolonged, 24 h period. Our new experimental insights were uniquely derived from the use of a rigorous experimental protocol that allowed viable cells with confirmed occurrence of sonoporation (and its absence) to be isolated for group-specific bioassay analysis (Fig.  1 ). Accordingly, our findings are seemingly more specific than those reported in past studies that did not account for the heterogeneity of bioeffects that tend to emerge in a sonicated cell population. The primary findings of this investigation are summarized in Fig.  6 . In general, our study has disentangled the downstream cellular impact of viable, sonoporated cells (the SNP+ group) from that of unsonoporated ones (the SNP-group). Over a 3-h time frame, sonoporated cells exhibited an upregulation of their HSP-70 expression levels (Fig.  5 ; gold bars). In the face of proteotoxic stress, such an enhanced expression of HSP-70 is supposed to play a cytoprotective role in a stressed cell's quest to maintain viability and to facilitate protein damage repair  30  . Nonetheless, our data has shown that a significant fraction of sonoporated cells lost viability over time  as they entered apoptosis and necrosis (Fig.  2 ; gold boxes). In turn, the proliferation trend of sonoporated cells was interrupted over a 24-h period (Fig.  3 ; orange line). The correpsonding cell-cycle distribution also became disordered (Fig.  4e ), wherein many sonoporated cells, after 12 h, had failed to progress into DNA synthesis (Fig.  4b ; gold bars) and had stalled from undergoing mitosis (Fig.  4c ; gold bars). Taken together, these findings have demonstrated that, in sonoporated cells, cytoprotective bioeffects may be triggered within the first few hours after exposure as these cells attempt to restore homeostasis after membrane resealing; yet, many of them failed to recover and ultimately lost viability over a 24 h period.

As illustrated in Fig.  6 , the fate of sonoporated cells is generally different from that observed in viable, unsonoporated cells (i.e. cells without membrane disruption after being subjected to ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles), even though these two cell groups have exhibited similar cytoprotective behavior. Over a 24-h period, unsonoporated cells mostly remained viable (Fig.  2 ; dark gray boxes) and showed proliferation characteristics (Fig.  3 ; gold line). Also, they had an increase in HSP-70 expression 3 h after exposure (Fig.  5 ; yellow bars) and had a perturbed cell-cycle distribution by 12 h after exposure (Fig.  4d ). These trends altogether suggest that unsonoporated cells, despite not undergoing membrane perforation, may still be reversibly stressed by ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles, but they were able to cope with this stress without losing viability over time. Regarding the downstream behavior of unsonoporated cells, one plausible mechanistic inference that can be drawn is that, because they were mechanically perturbed by the cavitational interactions between ultrasound and microbubbles, they consequently activated their cytoprotective signaling pathways and temporarily slowed their cell-cycle dynamics to promote cellular recovery. After they have restored cellular homeostasis, unsonoporated cells would resume their normal proliferation trend. Such a time-varying biological response is seemingly attributed to the presence of microbubbles during ultrasound exposure. In contrast, for cells that were sonicated in the absence of microbubbles (the US group), they did not exhibit significant changes in viability (Fig.  2 ; light gray boxes), cell-cycle distribution (Fig.  4a-c ; gray bars), and HSP-70 expression levels (Fig.  5 ; gray bars) as compared to the sham exposure group (the CTL group). Interestingly, the US group exhibited a growth spurt in its proliferation trend (Fig.  3 ; gray line) that resulted in a larger postexposure population size than the CTL group (Fig.  3 ; black line). This result corroborates with previous understanding that short-term cytomechanical perturbations with low-intensity ultrasound may lead to long-term growth stimulation of cells  31  . In general, our experiments have demonstrated that the downstream behavior of sonoporated and unsonoporated cells is characteristically different from that for cells that were sonicated in the absence of microbubbles (i.e. the US group in the presented results). Significance of research findings. Overall, our investigation has unveiled that multifaceted bioeffects, including both cytoprotective and cytotoxic phenomena, may be triggered on a time-lapsed basis after a sonoporation episode. This work has served well to prompt the need to re-consider how sonoporation should be more rationally incorporated in a drug delivery paradigm to enhance its efficacy. After all, in therapeutic studies, longterm cell viability is an essential efficacy indicator  32, 33  , and it plays a major role in cancer therapy in determining chemotherapy dosage and in planning treatment cycles  34, 35  . It would thus be worthwhile to devise a refined sonoporation-mediated drug delivery protocol to exploit the observed bioeffects to our advantage. For instance, one may leverage the cell-cycle disruption trends observed in this work to develop a revised treatment protocol that involves the use of cycle-specific drugs  36  . Regarding post-sonoporation cytoprotective maneuvers, we have identified the potential molecular facilitators involved in this process. In particular, HSP-70 genes were studied as the molecular targets. Interestingly, both sonoporated and unsonoporated cells exhibited a significant upregulation of HSP-70 genes a few hours after sonication in the presence of microbubbles. This finding suggested that these cells' self-protection, pro-survival machinery had been activated in response to the exposure. It is worth reiterating that, while unsonoporated cells managed to restore homeostasis within 24 h, a significant fraction of sonoporated cells had failed to recover and restore normal cell division activities. This difference in the time-lapsed developmental behavior of the two sonicated cell subpopulations indicate that other molecular pathways in addition to HSP-70 are likely involved at different post-exposure time points. In the future, it would be worthwhile to establish a more detailed account of the molecular orchestration of sonoporated cell fate (and compare them to that for unsonoporated cells). Further investigation on this topic will deepen our mechanistic understanding on sonoporation-induced bioeffects. It is worth emphasizing that our experiment protocol was specifically designed to analyze the downstream behavior of viable, sonoporated cells among a sonicated cell population. The ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure condition used in our protocol was well defined in vitro and was kept constant. Specifically, cells and microbubbles within the cell chamber were held in suspension such that they were uniformly distributed to ensure that cells were consistently sonicated with 1 MHz ultrasound pulses (with 0.50 MPa in-situ peak negative pressure) in the presence of microbubbles (with 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio). This way of realizing sonoporation is naturally more meticulous, yet different, from that for in vivo applications, where microbubbles are injected as a bolus into the blood stream and the in situ ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure conditions are not characterized. Since HL-60 leukemia cells are after all circulating cells in the vasculature, one further investigation that can be performed in the future will be to examine the extent of the observed sonoporation bioeffects in a flow phantom environment that more closely resembles physiologically relevant ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure conditions  37  . This further study will help to connect our reported research findings with in vivo application settings.

Our investigation has served well to underscore how sonoporation may instigate a variety of cellular impact over time. This new body of mechanistic knowledge can be leveraged in different ways. For instance, in sonoporationmediated chemotherapy, where the ultimate outcome is cell death, the intended drug action can be designed to synergize with the antiproliferation impact induced by sonoporation. In other drug delivery applications where cell survival is desired, efficiency may be improved by targeting HSP-70 signaling as a potential modulation pathway to boost the cytoprotective response of sonoporated cells, since our investigation has revealed that HSP-70 genes were upregulated as a cytoprotective maneuver to promote post-sonoporation cell recovery. In general, realizing rational use of sonoporation-mediated drug delivery will significantly broaden its application potential in biomedicine.

Exposure platform. The ultrasound apparatus employed in this investigation was an immersion-based exposure setup that coupled a secure-sealed cell chamber to a mounted ultrasound transducer with calibrated field levels within a 37 \u00b0C degassed water bath. Its design details have been established in our previous work  27  . In brief, its hardware components included a cylindrical ultrasound transducer with 1 MHz center frequency (\u00d825mm, Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA, USA), an arbitrary waveform generator (33120A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a broadband amplifier with 50 dB gain (2100L; E&I, Rochester, NY, USA), and a three-level acrylic-based mounting platform. The transducer and the secure-sealed cell chamber were respectively mounted to the bottom and middle panels of the mounting platform, and they were distanced at 10 cm apart. The platform's top panel served as an acoustic shield that prevented acoustic standing waves from emerging in the cell chamber. Acoustic parameters. During operation, sinusoidal pulses were first generated by the exposure platform's waveform generator, and they were fed into the broadband amplifier that relayed the amplified output to the ultrasound transducer. The waveform frequency was set at 1 MHz in accordance with the transducer's center frequency. Also, the pulse repetition frequency was set to 1 kHz, and the duration of each pulse was 100 cycles. These parameters corresponded to a 10% duty cycle. Exposure duration was set to 30 s in each experiment run. As calibrated previously  27  , in situ ultrasound exposure level was measured with a needle hydrophone (HMB-0500; Onda Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and an automated three-axis micro-positioner (ASTS-01; Onda Corporation). The spatial-average negative pressure was measured to be 0.50 MPa in the cell chamber region. The corresponding intensity values of interest were 9.71 W/cm 2 (spatial-peak, pulse-average) and 0.97 W/cm 2 (spatial-peak, time-average), and the delivered acoustic energy density was 29.1 J/cm 2 . Sonicated cell sample preparation. Cell culture. HL-60 leukemia cells (CCL-240; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were chosen as the experimental cell line in this study. Owing to its intrinsic deficiency in pro-apoptotic regulatory proteins  34  , this immortal cell line was naturally more resistant against pro-apoptotic stress. Such property served well as an intrinsic control in our investigation of anti-proliferation effects  35  . The HL-60 cells were routinely cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (R8758; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (American Type Culture Collection). The cell culture incubator was kept at 37 \u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Cell density were constantly monitored to ensure that they did not exceed 10 6 cells/ml. As such, exponential cell growth can be maintained. HL-60 cells were sub-cultured every three days. During sub-culture, cells were harvested in a sterilized 15 ml centrifuge tube (BDAA352196; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Afterward, supernatants were removed and the harvested cells were resuspended with fresh RPMI medium. Addition of sonoporation tracer. Calcein (C481, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed as the exogenous, fluorescent sonoporation tracer to facilitate the sorting of sonoporated cells using flow cytometry. They were added to the cell suspension at a 10 \u00b5M concentration 10 min before cells were transferred to the cell chamber. Note that calcein (Ex: 495 nm/Em: 515 nm) is a 623 Da macromolecule with a radius of 0.65 nm, which is normally unable to permeate the cell membrane and remain extracellularly in the cell medium. Upon the occurrence of sonoporation, calcein would infiltrate the cell membrane via the perforated site and subsequently bind to cytoplasmic calcium ions, thereby resulting in the emission of green fluorescence from the cytoplasm of sonoporated cells. Hence, in our experiments, post-exposure intracellular presence of calcein fluorescence served well to indicate that sonoporation had occurred in that sonicated cell. Addition of microbubbles. Commercial microbubbles (USphere Prime; TRUST Bio-Sonics, Taiwan) were used as the artificial gas nuclei for acoustic cavitation to trigger sonoporation. These microbubbles comprised a perfluorobutane gas core that was encapsulated by a phospholipid shell. They had a mean diameter of 2.09 \u00b5m, and less than 1.7% of the population were larger than 5 \u00b5m according to the manufacturer's data. During experiments, microbubbles were added to the cell suspension 3 min before the ultrasound exposure at a cell-to-bubble ratio of 1:1. Note that the choice of cell-to-bubble ratio plays a significant role in the resulting sonoporation efficiency  20  . The 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio was empirically found to provide a balance between inducing substantial sonoporation (> 30%) and minimizing instant cell death (< 20%) in our previous studies  25, 27  . With this cell-tobubble ratio and the prescribed acoustic exposure parameters, over 99% of the supplemented microbubbles were found to have collapsed after the 30 s exposure, as observed under bright-field microscope. Delivery of ultrasound exposure. Before exposure, the cell suspension (supplemented with microbubbles and calcein) was filled into the ultrasound exposure platform's cell chamber, which was acoustically transparent and was sterilized beforehand  27  . The cell chamber was securely sealed after filling and was promptly placed at the middle panel of the exposure platform. Thereafter, ultrasound exposure was delivered as described in the previous subsection. After exposure, cells were immediately taken out from the cell chamber and were incubated for 5 min to allow sonoporated cells to reseal their perforation sites and, in turn, to restore the resistance against the uptake of exogeneous molecules. Note that the post-exposure incubation time was set based on previously published findings that showed membrane resealing to be typically taking place within 1 min after the onset of a resealable sonoporation episode  11  . Isolation of sonoporated cells. Labeling of non-viable cells. Following the post-exposure incubation period, sonicated cells were transferred to 5-ml sterile flow cytometry tubes (352054; BD Biosciences). After rinsing them twice with RPMI medium, they were stained for 15-min with 0.75 \u00b5M PI (P4170, Sigma-Aldrich) to label non-viable sonicated cells whose membrane remain compromised after the sonoporation episode and the 5 min post-exposure incubation period. Afterwards, cells were washed twice with PBS. Identification of cell subpopulations with flow cytometry. Identification of subpopulations was achieved through calcein/PI bivariate fluorescence analysis of the sonicated cell samples using a flow cytometer (Aria III, BD Biosciences). In each flow cytometry run, data for 10 4 cells per sample was acquired at a rate of 300 events/s. Also, calcein fluorescence was measured with a 530/30 nm filter, and PI fluorescence was detected with a 616/23 nm filter. Cells showing positive PI fluorescence were deemed to belong to the non-viable population, while those showing positive calcein fluorescence were deemed to belong to the sonoporated cell population. Accordingly, the bivariate flow cytometry analysis allowed us to identify subpopulations of viable sonoporated cells (PI-/ calcein +), viable unsonoprated cells (PI-/calcein-), and non-viable cells that may or may not be sonoporated (PI + /calcein + and PI + /calcein-). Our previous data showed that among a sonicated HL-60 cell population, 41.9% were viable sonoporated cells  27  . Cell sorting. Using the FACS functionality of the flow cytometer, viable sonoporated cells (SNP+) and viable unsonoporated cells (SNP-) were isolated by setting each subpopulation's gate fluorescence level according to the observed bivariate fluorescence distribution in the post-exposure cell population sample. Non-viable cells were excluded from this sorting process. From each sorting experiment, 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells for each targeted subpopulation were collected. Note that cells were sorted at a rate of 3000 events/s flow rate to ensure the targeted number of cells can be harvested efficiently within 30 min. During the cell sorting process, the sheath fluid of flow cytometer and the sample container were maintained at 4 \u00b0C to preserve cell viability  38  . The harvested cell populations were immediately re-incubated until the corresponding time points for conducting biological assays. Note that cells of the sham control group (CTL) and a sonicated cell group that received ultrasound exposure in the absence of microbubbles (US) also went through the identical cell sorting procedures.

Apoptosis and necrosis analysis. Apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed using the Annexin-V/PI bivariate fluorescence assay at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure according to the established protocol  39  . For each sorted cell sample, 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells were harvested and were washed with 4 \u00b0C PBS. The samples were then resuspended in binding buffer (1 \u00d7 HEPES buffer solution). After centrifugation and removal of supernatants, each cell population sample was incubated with 5 \u03bcl Annexin-V (A23202, Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate, Invitrogen) and 1 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/mL PI in a 100 \u03bcl binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min. Annexin-V binding served to label instances of phosphatidylserine externalization manifested in cells undergoing early apoptosis, whereas cytoplasmic presence of PI served to label cells with compromised membrane permeability that is well regarded as a shared feature of late apoptotic and necrotic cells  39  . Subsequently, 400 \u03bcl binding buffer was added to each sample on ice. Flow cytometry was then applied using fluorescence with Ex/Em of 346/440 nm laser for Annexin-V and Ex/Em of 488/625 nm for PI. The cell group was then displayed as scatter plots with horizontal and vertical axis representing Annexin-V and PI level respectively. From this analysis, three groups of cells could be identified: (a) early apoptotic cells (PI-/Annexin V +); (b) late apoptotic or necrotic cells (PI +); (c) viable cells (PI-/annexin-V-). Note that this protocol cannot identify dead cells that had already been lysed at a given post-exposure time as they were inevitably removed by centrifugation. Cell proliferation analysis. The CCK-8 colorimetric assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., MD, USA) was carried out to determine the number of viable cells at different post-exposure times. This assay was chosen in view of its low cytotoxicity to living cells and high sensitivity comparing with other proliferation assays such as MTT. In each experiment, a sorted cell subpopulation sample was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and was resuspended into the culture medium at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. The cell suspension was then transferred to a 96-well plate with 100 \u00b5l per well. Subsequently, 10 \u00b5l of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. The 96-well place was incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 to foster reaction. The plate was afterward transferred to a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go; Thermo Scientific Inc.) and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. In each experiment, calibration samples were prepared by inoculating 5 \u00d7 10 3 , 1 \u00d7 10 4 , 2 \u00d7 10 4 , 4 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well respectively with identical volume of 100 \u00b5l. Cell cycle analysis. The cell-cycle distribution at different time points was examined by fixing the cell subpopulation sample and analyzing the fixed cells' DNA contents via PI fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The sorted cell populations were extracted at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure and was fixed with 75% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C for further analysis. Before carrying out the cell-cycle analysis, the fixed samples were washed with PBS to remove the ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were stained with 0.5 ml of PI solution (75 mM) in the dark at room temperature. The fluorescence of the PI-stained cells was analyzed by a flow cytometer following the standard protocol  40  . Histograms of PI fluorescence, which represent distribution of cellular DNA contents instead of cell viability because cells were already fixed, were then formed from 10,000 cell counts for each sample. Cells at G 0 /G 1 -,S-and G 2 /M-phases were gated and quantified from the DNA histogram. HSP-70 expression analysis. qPCR analysis was conducted to evaluate the mRNA level of HSPA6, HASPA1A, HSPA1B in each sorted population at 3 h after exposure. The three genes were chosen as they encode the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) that serve a cytoprotective function in response to disturbance of cell homeostasis via chaperon regulation  26  . Prior to the analysis, 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells were harvested for each sample and the total RNA of the sample was isolated with the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. To verify the quality of the extracted RNA, a quantitative estimation was conducted with the Multiskan GO spectrophotometer, and its integrity was double confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The qPCR reaction mix was prepared using a SYBR Fast qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Cycling and gene expression detection was conducted with a real-time PCR system (ABI-7500; Applied Biosystems). The primers used in the experiments are listed in Table  2 . RNA quantity was normalized using GAPDH content, and gene expression was quantified according to the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method  41  . Statistical evaluation. For all conducted bioassays, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to the acquired measurements to evaluate whether there were statistically significant differences in the data samples between cell groups and between different post-exposure time points. This statistical evaluation task was conducted using OriginPro (ver. 9.0; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). Trends of statistical significance were identified as ones with p values of < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, which respectively correspond to confidence intervals of 95%, 99%, and 99.9%.  Figure 1 . 1 Figure1. Experimental protocol for investigating the downstream cellular impact of sonoporation. A calibrated acoustic exposure platform was used to deliver ultrasound pulses to cell samples at 0 min. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was then performed to isolate sonoporated cells (SNP+ group) and unsonoporated cells (SNP-group). The development trends of each sorted cell group were then assayed at different postexposure time points over a 24 h period.

In this study, we theoretically calculated the dissolution dynamics of sulfur hexafluoride bubbles.

Some techniques in ultrasound-mediated diagnosis and therapy are dependent on the rapid collapse and fragmentation of microbubble (inertial cavitation (IC)) after receiving ultrasonic pulses with high peak negative pressure (PNP)  [3, 4] . For example, in flash echo imaging  [5] , destructionreperfusion imaging  [6]  and acoustic angiography  [7, 8] , the acoustic emissions from the rapid destruction of microbubbles are acquired to increase the sensitivity of detection in the target region. Shockwave or directional microjects from collapsing bubbles during IC can violently crack cancerous tissue, improving the efficiency of ablation  [9] , or perforate plasma membrane  [10, 11]  and open blood-brain-barrier  [12] , thus facilitating the delivery of therapeutic agents into the target region. Early optical observations showed that after rupture of the preformed microbubble shell, unconstrained smaller daughter bubbles (DBs) are generated  [13, 14] . Passive cavitation detection revealed that short rebound signals follow the IC signals, which also indicates that the preformed microbubbles rupture to form DBs  [15, 16] . Before DBs disappear because of static dissolution, they are able to grow and collapse essentially as new bubbles, thus undergo similar acoustic responses as the preformed microbubbles (i.e. scattering, linear or non-linear oscillation and fragmentation)  [17, 18] . This acoustically-driven behavior, which is closely related to the properties of the DBs, including gas diffusion, dissolution velocity and size distribution, may cause undesirable and uncontrolled bioeffects in the targeted region, such as cell necrosis or hemorrhage, thus influencing the biosafety and efficiency of ultrasound-based applications  [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, to control the biological responses elicited by IC, it is crucial to determine the properties of the DBs generated by IC. Various optical and acoustic methods have been used to estimate the lifetime and size distribution of cavitation bubbles and their relationships with the parameters of the used incident pulse. For example, two laser techniques, including laser diffraction and phase Doppler interferometry, are commonly used to measure the size distribution of microbubble clouds (e.g. from distilled water exposed to a 20-kHz horn) for different acoustic pressures  [22, 23] . Sonoluminescence (i.e. the light emission from collapsing microbubbles) or sonochemical luminescence (i.e. the light produced through chemical reaction of hydroxyl radicals with luminol) have also been used to determine the cavitation bubbles size for different acoustic frequencies and powers  [24, 25] . In another study, the void rate curve of bubbles measured using an electromagnetic resonator and the theoretical dissolution curve revealed that the size distribution of a cavitation bubble cloud (from air-saturated water exposed to 308-kHz ultrasound) is related to the acoustic pulse shape, acoustic pressure and exposure time  [26, 27] . Moreover, a recent study that used a time-intensity curve and bubble dissolution kinetics found that increasing the pulse length (PL) and PNP increases the proportion of large bubbles and small bubbles (from the nanodroplets exposed to a tone bust pulse of 1.2-MHz), respectively  [28] . Numerical calculations have also predicted that the active cavitation bubble size decreases and the size distribution narrows with increasing acoustic frequency, and that the radius decreases with increasing acoustic pressure  [29, 30] . Although the original of the cavitation bubbles (e.g. distilled water, luminol solution and nano-or micro-droplets that exposed to acoustic waves with high PNP) are essentially different from that of DBs (e.g. preformed microbubbles), these methods can also be used for reference to analyze the properties of DBs. Notably, previous studies have discriminated small DBs based on the measured dissolution process and the resonance features of dissolving bubbles  [31] . However, there has not been a comprehensive study evaluating the effect of the incident acoustic parameters on the properties of DBs generated by IC of the preformed bubbles. In this study, we established an experimental platform to evaluate the properties (lifetime, mean size and distribution range) of the DB population produced by IC of preformed SonoVue microbubbles. A single tone burst with different PNPs or PLs was used to elicit the fragmentation of microbubbles in an agarose phantom. Multiple tone bursts with fixed low PNP, PL and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) were used to track the temporal distribution of the scattering intensity of the resulting DBs. The lifetime and size distribution were calculated from the experimentally determined scattering intensity curves and the theoretically calculated dissolution curves of the DBs. Finally, the relationships between the properties of the DBs and the PNP and PL of the incident single tone burst were statistically determined.

A damping material (UA-1, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) was placed at the bottom of the water tank to minimize acoustic reflections, thereby forming a travelling wave field during exposure. Specifically, first, a single sinusoid signal with 1 MHz frequency and varied voltage amplitude and cycles (i.e. PL), produced by the signal generators 1 and amplified by a 50-dB radiofrequency amplifier (2100L; Electronics &Innovation Ltd, USA), was used to drive a 1-MHz single element plane transducer T1 with active diameter of 25.4 mm (Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA). This transducer was placed at a distance of 80 mm from the microbubble suspension in the agarose-gel phantom. This position was above the theoretical nearfield of the transducer on the acoustic axis, reducing the influence of slight variations in position (due to installment) on the acoustic pressure distribution in the target region. Because this transducer was used to elicit the violent collapse and disintegration of the preformed SonoVue microbubbles, the PNP should exceed the PNP threshold for inducing IC of the microbubbles. We varied the PNP and PL to analyze the influence of these parameters on the properties of the DBs. Next, 1 ms after the emission of the single tone burst, the multiple tone bursts signal with 5 MHz frequency, fixed voltage amplitude, PL and PRF, (output from signal generator 2 and amplified by another 50-dB radiofrequency amplifier), was applied to drive a 5-MHz plane transducer (T2) (Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA). This transducer had an active diameter of 13 mm and was installed at a distance of 50 mm from the sample region. We note that the pulse parameters need to be rationally selected to obtain a temporal distribution of the scattering intensity of DBs. According to our preliminary measurements, a 1-kHz PRF was selected to achieve high temporal resolution when tracking the static dissolution process of DBs and to avoid acousticallydriven diffusion, which can occur at higher PRFs. A PL of 4 \u00b5s was selected to reduce the probability of acoustically-driven diffusion. The PNP of 0.08 MPa is sufficient for exciting the scattering of DBs, while avoiding acoustically-driven diffusion or stable cavitation. The transmitting pressure waveforms from these two transducers were separately calibrated using a capsule hydrophone (HGL-0200, ONDA, USA) in the sample region for different voltage amplitudes. The calibration details are provided in our previous reports  [33, 34] . The -3-dB profiles of T1 and T2 have diameters of ~15.5 and ~7.3 mm, respectively.

In our previous reports, we determined that the PNP threshold for inducing IC of SonoVue microbubbles is ~0.40 MPa. Therefore, we used 0.60 MPa as the minimum PNP for inducing IC in this study. After the control saline solution and preformed SonoVue microbubbles were exposed to a single tone ultrasound pulse with a PL of 100 \u00b5s and PNP of 0.60 MPa, the time-and frequency-domain curves of the acoustic signals were measured and shown in Figure  3A  and 3B. As shown in Figure  3A , the mean amplitude of the signal from the preformed microbubbles was higher than that from the saline solution. Only the fundamental frequency is observed in the frequency spectrum from control saline solution in Figure  3B . By contrast, in the frequency spectrum of the microbubbles, the fundamental frequency and the broadband frequency components are enhanced, suggesting that the microbubbles had underwent IC. After exposure to a single tone burst with a higher PNP of 1.1 MPa and 100-\u00b5s PL , in the control saline solution, although the amplitude of signals in time-domain markedly increased in Fig.  3C  (compared with those in Figure  3A ), only fundamental frequency and almost no obvious broadband signals were observed in Fig.  3D , suggesting the used acoustic parameters don't induce the occurrence of cavitation in control saline solution (including agarose-gel phantom and water). However, in the microbubbles solution, the amplitudes of both the time-domain signals and broadband components notably increased (Figure  3C  and 3D ), suggesting an enhancement of IC of the preformed microbubbles. We further determined the relationships between the IC dose and the PNP and PL. As shown in Figure  3E , the IC dose gradually increased with increasing PNP. For example, the IC dose was 6.65\u00d710 -9 V 2 s at 0.6 MPa and 2.10\u00d710 -8 V 2 s at 1.6 MPa. Similarly, the IC dose was positively correlated with PL, as shown in Figure  3F . When the PL was increased from 5 to 100 \u00b5s, the IC dose increased from 1.26\u00d710 -9 to 1.56 \u00d7 10 -8 V 2 s. These results show that the extent of microbubble collapse and fragmentation increases at higher acoustic energy, which can be achieved either by increasing the PNP or PL.

These conditions were appropriate to excite the scattering from DBs while avoiding acoustically-driven diffusion. Figure  4A  and 4B show the time-and frequency-domain curves of the control saline and preformed microbubble solutions exposed to these pulses. The amplitudes of the time-domain signals (Figure  4A ) from the control and microbubble solutions were relatively stable for a long period (here, we only show a 200-ms period), suggesting that the size of the microbubbles remained unchanged, and the microbubble population did not undergo acoustically-driven diffusion. Only the fundamental frequency of 5 MHz could be observed in the control saline solution, as shown in Figure  4B . In addition to the fundamental frequency, almost no sub-harmonics, harmonics or ultraharmonics were observed in the frequency spectrum of the microbubbles solution (only second-order harmonics with very small magnitude were observed), suggesting that the microbubble population only produced scattering signals, and did not nonlinearly oscillate after receiving these acoustic pulses. Figure  4C  shows that the scattering intensities from the control and microbubble solution are stable with the exposure time. These results show that the application of multiple tone bursts has little influence on the stability of the microbubbles, and could therefore be used to investigate the static dissolution process of DBs. After the preformed microbubbles were exposed to a single tone burst with a high PNP, multiple tone bursts were used to excite the scattering from the DB population during their static dissolution. Figure  4D  shows that the amplitude of the scattering signal from DBs gradually reduces to the control level with increasing exposure time. Only the fundamental frequency was observed in the frequency spectrum (Figure  4E ), suggesting that DBs only scatter the incident acoustic waves. Moreover, the scattering intensity gradually decreases with the exposure time, and finally approaches the control level, as shown in Figure  4F .

Figure  5A  and 5B show two typical scattering intensity curves from the samples. The samples were first exposed to single tone burst with PNPs of 0.6 and 1.6 MPa, respectively, and then, after a l-ms delay, were exposed to a 4-\u00b5s pulse with 0.08-MPa PNP and 1-kHz PRF for 1 s. The fitted scattering intensity curve in Figure  5A  shows that the amplitudes of the scattering signals from the bubble solution (which was excited by a single tone burst with 0.6-MPa PNP) continuously decreased in the first ~150 ms, and then gradually approached a stable level (close to that in the control saline solution) after ~220 ms. This trend indicates that the scattering crosssection of the DB population gradually decreased owing to the decreasing bubble radius during static dissolution. From Figure  5A , we can see that the scattering intensity deceased to 0.16\u00d710 -6 v 2 s at ~225 ms after exposure to multiple tone bursts, followed by a very small reduction (less than the 1% of the maximum intensity) in the next time, so ~225 ms corresponds to the lifetime of the DB population. The calculated size distribution of DBs is shown in Figure  5C . The distribution was Gaussian, with the proportions of bubbles larger and smaller than the resonance size (\u2248 0.86 \u00b5m) being 65.70% and 34.30%, respectively. The corresponding mean size and FWHH were 1.21 \u00b5m and 1.52 \u00b5m, respectively. By contrast, after exposure to a single tone burst with PNP of 1.6 MPa, similar scattering intensity trend but with a faster decay was observed in Figure  5B , suggesting a faster dissolution rate of the DBs formed. Similar distribution characteristics can be seen in Figure  5D , although the lifetime (89.37 ms), mean size (0.77 \u00b5m) and FWHH (0.82 \u00b5m) are smaller in this case. The relationships between the PNP and the lifetime, mean bubble size and FWHH are shown in Figure  5E -G, respectively. The lifetime decreases from 222.5 to 76.3 ms with an increase of the PNP from 0.6 to 1.6 MPa. In the DB population, the proportion of corresponding smaller bubbles (< resonance size) increased from 36.83% to 85.98% while the proportion of larger bubbles (> resonance size) decreased from 63.17% to 14.02%. With increasing PNP, the mean bubble size decreased from 1.21 to 0.70 \u00b5m and the distribution (FWHH) narrowed from 1.52 to 0.79 \u00b5m. These results show that the increasing PNP caused a shift of DBs to smaller bubbles with shorter life time.  The relationships between the PL of the incident single tone burst and the lifetime, mean size and FWHH of DBs are shown in Figure  6E-G . Figure  6E  shows that the lifetime gradually decreased with increasing PL. The rate of decrease was greatest at PL < 20 \u00b5s, suggesting that these PLs have the greater influence on the formation of large DBs. The proportion of large bubbles (> resonance size) decreased with increasing PL, from 74.26% for a 5-\u00b5s pulse to 4.92% for a 100-\u00b5s pulse. The corresponding proportion of small bubbles (< resonance size) increased from 25.74% to 95.08%. Moreover, it can be seen in Figure  6F  and 6G that with increasing PL from 5 to 100 \u00b5s, the mean size of the DBs decreased from 1.45 \u00b5m to 0.58 \u00b5m, and the FWHH decreased from 2.07 to 0.53 \u00b5m. These results show that the increasing PL caused a larger proportion of small bubbles with shorter lifetime in the DB population.

Based on their observation, we conclude that the preformed microbubbles fragmented into DBs because the scattering intensity rapidly decreased to a relatively lower level than that obtained before the single tone burst emission. Moreover, the size of DBs (0.23-2.7 \u00b5m) in their study is in agreement with our results, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that an increase of the PNP reduces the lifetime and mean size of the DB population (due to the increase of small bubble), and narrows the size distribution range. A previous study that measured void rate dissipation showed that an increase in acoustic pressure increased the proportion of small bubbles in the cavitation bubble cloud  [26] . Other studies using the ultrasound wide-beam method also found that a higher PNP favored the formation of the small bubbles in acoustic droplet vaporization. Therefore, our results are consistent with those of these studies. Further, early optical observations, which provide direct proof of this relationship, determined that a higher PNP can increase the amplitude (in the expansion phase) of microbubble oscillation, and increase the velocity and acceleration of the shell wall (i.e. enhancing instability)  [13] . This means that the violent collapse produces more shell fragments, resulting in the larger proportion of small DBs. Our results also show that a longer PL causes a shift of the DB population to the smaller bubbles with shorter lifetime and narrower distribution. This result is also consistent with an early study, which used the 'rebound' signal to detect DBs generated by the rupture of the preformed bubbles  [15] . In that study, the amplitude of the rebound signal markedly increased with PL for a given incident PNP, indicative of more small bubbles in DBs population  [15] . However, other studies have reported that a longer PL increases the size of cavitation bubbles  [28] . This discrepancy may be due to the following reason. The DBs in our study were produced from pre-formed microbubbles exposed to a single tone burst, whereas cavitation bubbles are formed from the solution (e.g. degassed water, luminol solution and nanodroplets solution) exposed to highintensity ultrasound. Moreover, in previous studies, no obvious increase was observed in the extent of bubble expansion when increasing the PL; however, a longer PL was found to cause preformed microbubbles to produce more shell fragments, therefore resulting in the increase in the proportion of small bubbles  [13, 14] . In addition, a longer PL could cause the coalescence of cavitation bubbles or gas diffusion from the surrounding medium, leading to an increase in the mean bubble size  [17, 26, 28] . Figure  3E  and 3F show that the IC dose positively correlated with the PNP and PL. Noted that the same sampling points (16384) (or sampling time ) 252.06 \u00d7 10 -6 \u00b5s were used when the PL was changed in the single tone burst. Therefore, ICD proportional to PL is mainly due to the increasing intensities of the broadband components (the increasing IC extent). Moreover, the degree of microbubble rupture increased with increasing PNP and PL  [24, 25, 29, 30] . Therefore, we conclude that the increase of the IC dose can cause an increase in the degree of microbubble rupture, resulting in a large proportion of small DBs with a short lifetime and narrow distribution. This trend is consistent with the results of previous studies looking at the effect of acoustic power using laser diffraction and phase Doppler interferometry  [22, 23] . However, our results differ from those obtained using the sonoluminescence intensity method, which determined that the radius increases with an increase in acoustic power  [24] . This may due to the relativity low acoustic power range used in this research. However, at higher acoustic power, numerical calculations of multi-bubble systems determine that because of the stronger nonlinear pulsations, the radius decreases with the increasing acoustic pressure (from increasing acoustic power)  [30] .

It is known that when the excitation frequency approaches the resonance frequency of the bubbles, the bubbles start to resonate  [39] . Thus, during the dissolution process of DBs, the change of scattering cross-section with the radius will undergo a resonance peak, and doesn't follow the exponential decay function. However, in our lots of repeated experiments, the temporal curve of the measured scattering intensity still exhibited exponential attenuation trend, and almost no obviously sudden change (corresponding to the resonance peak) was observed. Previous report explained that the resonance peak for each bubble may be smeared due to the polydispersity of the DBs population, resulting in the exponential decay of the measured scattering intensity  [28] . Thus, similar to the previous report  [28]  , the exponential decay function was used to fit the time variation of scattering cross-section during the static dissolution process. On the other hand, although another exponential decay function was fitted to eliminate the influence of the resonance peak, the modified scattering cross-section will cause some errors in the estimated size distribution. Therefore, to obtain accurate size distribution of DBs, using monodisperse microbubbles or a single microbubble may ensure the curve of measured scattering intensity is consistent with the theoretical calculations. According to the theoretical calculation, the dissolution time of DBs with 0.2 \u00b5m radius is ~1.6 ms. The time interval between turning off the 1MHz ultrasound and turning on the 5 MHz ultrasound is 1 ms in this measurement system. The propagation time of acoustic waves in experimental system is ~85.67 \u00b5s. So, the minimal radius that can be differentiated by this system was ~0.2 \u00b5m, and DBs with radius less than 0.2 \u00b5m can't detected. Thus, some smaller DBs may be out of consideration when using this measurement system. More fast and accurate measurement system is needed for the cases of smaller DBs generation. Previous experimental and numerical studies also determined that a higher acoustic frequency increases the proportion of small cavitation bubbles and narrows the size distribution  [17, 24] . The expansion amplitude of the preformed bubbles is also dependent on the ultrasonic frequency, with previous studies showing that a lower frequency increases the expansion amplitude and fragmentation, which increases the number of small bubbles  [13] .

Our method to determine the properties of DBs can provide a feedback for optimizing the incident acoustic parameters (i.e. the PNP, PL and center frequency). For example, although some pulse modes (e.g. short pulses with high PRF) achieve uniform spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation dose in the target region  [40, 41] , the DBs formed by the previous incident pulse may generate secondary cavitation after receiving the next incident pulse, resulting in non-uniform distribution of the cavitation activity. To eliminate these undesired acoustic responses, the PRF in short-pulse mode should be as long as possible to exceed the lifetime of DBs. Moreover, an appropriate period between pulses can stabilize the bubble size distribution within the active radius range, thereby producing a controllable bubble response  [25, 27] . Therefore, understanding the properties of DBs generated by IC could provide guidance for achieving controllable and desirable outcomes in cavitation-based applications.

We determined that increasing the PNP reduces the lifetime and mean size of the DB population, and narrows the size distribution. Moreover, increasing the PL increases the proportion of small bubbles with short lifetime, and narrows the size distribution of the DBs. We conclude that the IC dose is related to the properties of the DB population. With increasing IC dose, the mean bubble size decreases, the lifetime of the DB population shortens and its size distribution narrows. Thus, this study shows that the properties of DBs can be predetermined according to the parameters of the incident acoustic pulse, and that controllable cavitation activity can be achieved by optimizing the acoustic parameters.

Sonoporation was realized on HL-60 leukemia cells by delivering pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz frequency, 0.50 MPa peak negative pressure; 10% duty cycle; 30 s exposure period; 29.1 J/cm 2 acoustic energy density) in the presence of lipid-shelled microbubbles (1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio). Results showed that 54.6% of sonoporated cells, despite remaining initially viable, underwent apoptosis or necrosis at 24 h after sonoporation. Anti-proliferation behavior was also observed in sonoporated cells as their subpopulation size was reduced by 43.8% over 24 h. Preceding these cytotoxic events, the percentages of sonoporated cells in different cell cycle phases were found to be altered by 12 h after exposure. As well, for sonoporated cells, their expressions of cytoprotective genes in the heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) family were upregulated by at least 4.1 fold at 3 h after exposure.

Alas, sonoporation-mediated drug delivery has yet to reach widespread clinical use, as the efficiency of this approach has been deemed to be mediocre  8  . Detailed understanding on sonoporation mechanisms has long been regarded as vital to determine how sonoporation may be efficiently realized without inducing unwanted confounding effects  9, 10  . On this topic, not only is it important to unravel the acute biophysical impact of sonoporation  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  , the downstream cellular bioeffects of sonoporation after membrane resealing also need to be accounted for  16  . Without such mechanistic understanding, pursuing rational use of sonoporation in biomedicine inherently becomes more challenging  8, 10, 16  . Although it is recognized that analyzing the downstream bioeffects of sonoporation is critical to enhance its practical efficiency, such analyses are not trivial to carry out properly from an experimental design standpoint. One known issue is that, when using ultrasound and microbubbles to induce sonoporation in a cell population, such exposure would lead to a heterogeneity of response among the sonicated cells  17, 18  . In particular, not all sonicated cells may undergo sonoporation, and some of them may instantly lose viability  17, 19  . Such heterogeneity, if neglected, fundamentally represents a significant confounding factor in the analysis of sonoporation-induced cellular bioeffects. Previously, without acknowledging the heterogeneity of cell response, some studies have shown that ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles may lead to cell lysis  20, 21  , apoptosis  22  , cell cycle arrest  23  , and morphological changes  24, 25  . Yet, it remains unclear as to whether these biological effects are specific to sonoporation or whether they are merely attributed to ultrasound exposure. In this paper, we present a new substantiated body of evidence on the downstream cellular impact of sonoporation by properly differentiating the bioeffects of viable sonoporated cells from other sonicated cells. The focus of our investigation is on analyzing sonoporated cells' post-resealing viability, proliferation trend, cell-cycle distribution, and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) expression level, the last of which is known to be upregulated when cells are stressed  26  . Such an analysis allows us to more precisely identify whether, after membrane resealing has taken place, sonoporation may induce cellular impact that could be cytoprotective or cytotoxic in nature. Here, we have sought to test the overall hypothesis that various downstream bioeffects of sonoporated cells, such as proliferation behavior and HSP-70 expression levels, are different from those for cells that merely received ultrasound exposure. We further hypothesized that, in sonoporated cells, alterations in cell proliferation kinetics and HSP-70 expressions may emerge hours after ultrasound exposure when membrane integrity has long been restored.

As illustrated in Fig.  1  and described in the Methods section, the protocol involves the use of a calibrated, immersion-based ultrasound exposure setup (1 MHz ultrasound frequency, 10% duty cycle, 0.50 MPa in-situ peak negative pressure, 30 s exposure period, 29.1 J/cm 2 acoustic energy density). Experiments were conducted using HL-60 leukemia cells (CCL240, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) as the cell model, because their pro-apoptotic protein deficiency  28  suitably acted as an experimental control in our investigation that included analysis of sonoporation-induced anti-proliferation effects  29  . Microbubbles (USphere Prime; Trust Biosonics, Hsinchu, Taiwan) were injected into the cell chamber at a 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio to serve as sonoporation agents. Such a cell-to-bubble ratio is known to efficiently trigger the onset of sonoporation without significantly inducing instant cell death  20  . As shown previously, our exposure protocol yielded an average sonoporation rate of 41.9% among sonicated HL-60 cells  27  . In this investigation, sonicated cells were re-incubated for 5 min after exposure to allow for membrane resealing to take place. Such post-exposure re-incubation period effectively took into consideration previous direct observations that showed how membrane resealing would typically happen within 1 min from the onset of a resealable sonoporation episode  11  . Afterward, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was carried out. Two subpopulations were accordingly isolated for cellular impact analysis: (i) viable sonoporated cells (SNP+ group); (ii) viable unsonoporated cells (SNP-group). To facilitate comparison, experiments were also conducted for: (i) a control cell group (CTL group) with sham exposure; (ii) a sonicated cell group (US group) that received exposure in the absence of microbubbles. As presented in the following subsections, our investigation has yielded a new, unique body of experimental insights on the downstream bioeffects that emerged in viable sonoporated cells (i.e. SNP+ group) at different post-resealing time points.  For the SNP+ group, significant emergence of dead cells, which may stem from late apoptosis or necrosis, was found over 24 h. Figure  2b  shows the trend of the percentage of dead cells in the four tested cell groups over 24 h after exposure. As can been observed, dead cells in the SNP+ group had a significantly higher population than those in the CTL group at 8 h (p < 0.05), 12 h (p < 0.001), and 24 h (p < 0.001). The average percentage of dead cells in the SNP+ group reached 28.8% at 12 h. The dead cell percentage subsequently dropped to 18.5% at 24 h after exposure because some dead cells, whether they originate from the apoptosis or necrosis pathways, had already been lysed by that time and could no longer be detected by flow cytometry. In contrast, the SNP-and US groups had dead cell percentages below 20% over 24 h. Both groups showed no significant difference in dead cells between them and with respect to the CTL group at 24 h. The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells in each group at different post-exposure time points is plotted in Fig.  2c . The data points were derived by summing the early apoptotic (Annexin-V + and PI-) and dead cell (PI +) populations. The primary observation to be noted is that for cells in the SNP+ group, over half of them failed to survive at 24 h after exposure (apoptotic and necrotic cells on average accounted for 54.6% of group population). Since some dead cells were already lysed and were thus not detectable after 24 h, the actual number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in the SNP+ group may be even higher than that reported in Fig.  2c . Note that the significant rise in the SNP+ group's apoptotic and necrotic cell subpopulation (p < 0.001) started to emerge at 12 h after exposure. In contrast, the average apoptotic and necrotic cell percentage in the SNP-group merely comprised 16.8% of the group population at 24 h after exposure. This trend is similar to that observed for the CTL and US groups. Viable sonoporated cells exhibited anti-proliferation behavior. Proliferation of cells in the SNP+ group was found to be halted over a 24-h post-exposure observation period. Figure  3  presents the normalized cell population of each group at 3, 8, 12 and 24 h after exposure as obtained from a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) bioassay. CTL, US and SNP-groups showed a rising trend in their population over 24 h, while the SNP+ group exhibited a substantial decrease in population. The population of CTL and US groups did not exhibit a statistically significant change from 3 to 8 h after exposure, whereas SNP+ and SNP-populations were decreased over the same period (p < 0.001 for SNP+ ; p < 0.01 for SNP-). Subsequently, at 12 h after exposure, the SNP-group by-and-large restored its population to the baseline level (with no statistically significant difference in comparison to the SNP-population at 3 h). In contrast, the SNP+ cells were still significantly lower than the initial population (p < 0.001). The low population of SNP+ persisted at 24 h after exposure, while the other three groups exhibited a population growth trend from 12 to 24 h. To quantify the differences in the proliferation trends of the four groups, we calculated the post-exposure proliferation rate as the ratio of the population at 24 h to the population at 3 h. As shown in Table  1 , the average proliferation rate of the CTL, US and SNP-cell groups were accordingly found to be 1.75, 2.12, and 1.31 respectively. In contrast, the average proliferation rate of the SNP+ group was estimated to be 0.56, which corresponds to an average population loss of 44% from 3 to 24 h. The population changes from 8 to 12 h (\u0394 1 ) and from 12 to 24 h (\u0394 2 ) were also calculated to evaluate the transient cell growth trend of each group. Results showed that over the period between 8 and 12 h, the SNP+ group population increased transiently by 60.1% on average (p < 0.001). Yet, this group's population did not continue its rising trend from 12 to 24 h, as no statistically significant difference was found between the SNP+ group populations at 12 h and 24 h (the 13.2% decrease stated in Table  1  only exhibited weak statistical difference; p < 0.1). This population trend is different from the growth trends for the CTL, US, and SNP-cell groups, all of which experienced a statistically significant population increase from 8 to 12 h and from 12 to 24 h.

The results of cell proliferation rates suggested differences in the cell division activities of the four groups of cells. To investigate the impact of the exposure on each phase of cell division, a time-lapse cell cycle analysis was conducted at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure via flow cytometry analysis of the cells' deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contents. This analysis focused on the subgroup size of three cell-cycle phases: (i) G 0 /G 1 phase (cells in quiescence or in preparation for DNA synthesis); (ii) S phase (cells undergoing DNA synthesis); (iii) G 2 /M phase (cells after completion of DNA synthesis but have not yet divided). For the four cell groups of interest, Fig.  4a-c  show the percentage of cells in the three phases as a function of post-exposure time. The CTL and US groups remained at similar distribution levels for each phase of cell cycle progression over 24 h after exposure. In contrast, the SNP+ and SNP-groups had shown fluctuations in the cellcycle distribution from 8 h onward. Specifically, as highlighted in Fig.  4e , the percentage of S-phase cells in the SNP+ group decreased slightly at 8 h, and it further declined at 12 h (p < 0.001). In sync with the latter trend, at 12 h, there was a commensurate rise in the percentage of cells in the G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases (p < 0.01). At 24 h, in the SNP+ cell group, we observed respectively a persistent reduction and increase in the size of the S-phase and G 0 /G 1 -phase subgroups (p < 0.001), while the size of the G 2 /M-phase subgroup returned to the baseline level.

The cell-cycle disruption trends observed in the SNP+ and SNP-cell groups indicated that their subcellular stress signal expressions may be concomitantly altered over time. To investigate the potential downstream molecular bioeffects of ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles, we evaluated the post-exposure transcription levels of three HSP-70 genes (HSPA1A, HSPA1B and HSPA6) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. These three genes encode the key proteins of the HSP70 family, which play a cytoprotective role in a cell's protein folding machinery and is highly conserved in all organisms. Figure  5  shows the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression level of the HSPA1A, HSPA1B and HSPA6 genes at 3 h after exposure.

Sonoporation, despite being considered as a promising membrane perforation technique with strong application potential in drug/gene delivery, has not yet reached widespread clinical use largely because its mechanistic foundations are still not well characterized. Results from our investigation have allowed us to form new perspectives on the cellular impact of sonoporation by revealing how this membrane perforation approach, even whilst it may not affect the viability of target cells, may jeopardize post-exposure cellular homeostasis over a prolonged, 24 h period. Our new experimental insights were uniquely derived from the use of a rigorous experimental protocol that allowed viable cells with confirmed occurrence of sonoporation (and its absence) to be isolated for group-specific bioassay analysis (Fig.  1 ). Accordingly, our findings are seemingly more specific than those reported in past studies that did not account for the heterogeneity of bioeffects that tend to emerge in a sonicated cell population. The primary findings of this investigation are summarized in Fig.  6 . In general, our study has disentangled the downstream cellular impact of viable, sonoporated cells (the SNP+ group) from that of unsonoporated ones (the SNP-group). Over a 3-h time frame, sonoporated cells exhibited an upregulation of their HSP-70 expression levels (Fig.  5 ; gold bars). In the face of proteotoxic stress, such an enhanced expression of HSP-70 is supposed to play a cytoprotective role in a stressed cell's quest to maintain viability and to facilitate protein damage repair  30  . Nonetheless, our data has shown that a significant fraction of sonoporated cells lost viability over time  as they entered apoptosis and necrosis (Fig.  2 ; gold boxes). In turn, the proliferation trend of sonoporated cells was interrupted over a 24-h period (Fig.  3 ; orange line). The correpsonding cell-cycle distribution also became disordered (Fig.  4e ), wherein many sonoporated cells, after 12 h, had failed to progress into DNA synthesis (Fig.  4b ; gold bars) and had stalled from undergoing mitosis (Fig.  4c ; gold bars). Taken together, these findings have demonstrated that, in sonoporated cells, cytoprotective bioeffects may be triggered within the first few hours after exposure as these cells attempt to restore homeostasis after membrane resealing; yet, many of them failed to recover and ultimately lost viability over a 24 h period.

As illustrated in Fig.  6 , the fate of sonoporated cells is generally different from that observed in viable, unsonoporated cells (i.e. cells without membrane disruption after being subjected to ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles), even though these two cell groups have exhibited similar cytoprotective behavior. Over a 24-h period, unsonoporated cells mostly remained viable (Fig.  2 ; dark gray boxes) and showed proliferation characteristics (Fig.  3 ; gold line). Also, they had an increase in HSP-70 expression 3 h after exposure (Fig.  5 ; yellow bars) and had a perturbed cell-cycle distribution by 12 h after exposure (Fig.  4d ). These trends altogether suggest that unsonoporated cells, despite not undergoing membrane perforation, may still be reversibly stressed by ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles, but they were able to cope with this stress without losing viability over time. Regarding the downstream behavior of unsonoporated cells, one plausible mechanistic inference that can be drawn is that, because they were mechanically perturbed by the cavitational interactions between ultrasound and microbubbles, they consequently activated their cytoprotective signaling pathways and temporarily slowed their cell-cycle dynamics to promote cellular recovery. After they have restored cellular homeostasis, unsonoporated cells would resume their normal proliferation trend. Such a time-varying biological response is seemingly attributed to the presence of microbubbles during ultrasound exposure. In contrast, for cells that were sonicated in the absence of microbubbles (the US group), they did not exhibit significant changes in viability (Fig.  2 ; light gray boxes), cell-cycle distribution (Fig.  4a-c ; gray bars), and HSP-70 expression levels (Fig.  5 ; gray bars) as compared to the sham exposure group (the CTL group). Interestingly, the US group exhibited a growth spurt in its proliferation trend (Fig.  3 ; gray line) that resulted in a larger postexposure population size than the CTL group (Fig.  3 ; black line). This result corroborates with previous understanding that short-term cytomechanical perturbations with low-intensity ultrasound may lead to long-term growth stimulation of cells  31  . In general, our experiments have demonstrated that the downstream behavior of sonoporated and unsonoporated cells is characteristically different from that for cells that were sonicated in the absence of microbubbles (i.e. the US group in the presented results). Significance of research findings. Overall, our investigation has unveiled that multifaceted bioeffects, including both cytoprotective and cytotoxic phenomena, may be triggered on a time-lapsed basis after a sonoporation episode. This work has served well to prompt the need to re-consider how sonoporation should be more rationally incorporated in a drug delivery paradigm to enhance its efficacy. After all, in therapeutic studies, longterm cell viability is an essential efficacy indicator  32, 33  , and it plays a major role in cancer therapy in determining chemotherapy dosage and in planning treatment cycles  34, 35  . It would thus be worthwhile to devise a refined sonoporation-mediated drug delivery protocol to exploit the observed bioeffects to our advantage. For instance, one may leverage the cell-cycle disruption trends observed in this work to develop a revised treatment protocol that involves the use of cycle-specific drugs  36  . Regarding post-sonoporation cytoprotective maneuvers, we have identified the potential molecular facilitators involved in this process. In particular, HSP-70 genes were studied as the molecular targets. Interestingly, both sonoporated and unsonoporated cells exhibited a significant upregulation of HSP-70 genes a few hours after sonication in the presence of microbubbles. This finding suggested that these cells' self-protection, pro-survival machinery had been activated in response to the exposure. It is worth reiterating that, while unsonoporated cells managed to restore homeostasis within 24 h, a significant fraction of sonoporated cells had failed to recover and restore normal cell division activities. This difference in the time-lapsed developmental behavior of the two sonicated cell subpopulations indicate that other molecular pathways in addition to HSP-70 are likely involved at different post-exposure time points. In the future, it would be worthwhile to establish a more detailed account of the molecular orchestration of sonoporated cell fate (and compare them to that for unsonoporated cells). Further investigation on this topic will deepen our mechanistic understanding on sonoporation-induced bioeffects. It is worth emphasizing that our experiment protocol was specifically designed to analyze the downstream behavior of viable, sonoporated cells among a sonicated cell population. The ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure condition used in our protocol was well defined in vitro and was kept constant. Specifically, cells and microbubbles within the cell chamber were held in suspension such that they were uniformly distributed to ensure that cells were consistently sonicated with 1 MHz ultrasound pulses (with 0.50 MPa in-situ peak negative pressure) in the presence of microbubbles (with 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio). This way of realizing sonoporation is naturally more meticulous, yet different, from that for in vivo applications, where microbubbles are injected as a bolus into the blood stream and the in situ ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure conditions are not characterized. Since HL-60 leukemia cells are after all circulating cells in the vasculature, one further investigation that can be performed in the future will be to examine the extent of the observed sonoporation bioeffects in a flow phantom environment that more closely resembles physiologically relevant ultrasound-microbubble mediated exposure conditions  37  . This further study will help to connect our reported research findings with in vivo application settings.

Our investigation has served well to underscore how sonoporation may instigate a variety of cellular impact over time. This new body of mechanistic knowledge can be leveraged in different ways. For instance, in sonoporationmediated chemotherapy, where the ultimate outcome is cell death, the intended drug action can be designed to synergize with the antiproliferation impact induced by sonoporation. In other drug delivery applications where cell survival is desired, efficiency may be improved by targeting HSP-70 signaling as a potential modulation pathway to boost the cytoprotective response of sonoporated cells, since our investigation has revealed that HSP-70 genes were upregulated as a cytoprotective maneuver to promote post-sonoporation cell recovery.

In brief, its hardware components included a cylindrical ultrasound transducer with 1 MHz center frequency (\u00d825mm, Advanced Devices, Wakefield, MA, USA), an arbitrary waveform generator (33120A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a broadband amplifier with 50 dB gain (2100L; E&I, Rochester, NY, USA), and a three-level acrylic-based mounting platform. The transducer and the secure-sealed cell chamber were respectively mounted to the bottom and middle panels of the mounting platform, and they were distanced at 10 cm apart. The platform's top panel served as an acoustic shield that prevented acoustic standing waves from emerging in the cell chamber. Acoustic parameters. During operation, sinusoidal pulses were first generated by the exposure platform's waveform generator, and they were fed into the broadband amplifier that relayed the amplified output to the ultrasound transducer. The waveform frequency was set at 1 MHz in accordance with the transducer's center frequency. Also, the pulse repetition frequency was set to 1 kHz, and the duration of each pulse was 100 cycles. These parameters corresponded to a 10% duty cycle. Exposure duration was set to 30 s in each experiment run. As calibrated previously  27  , in situ ultrasound exposure level was measured with a needle hydrophone (HMB-0500; Onda Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and an automated three-axis micro-positioner (ASTS-01; Onda Corporation). The spatial-average peak negative pressure was measured to be 0.50 MPa in the cell chamber region. The corresponding intensity values of interest were 9.71 W/cm 2 (spatial-peak, pulse-average) and 0.97 W/cm 2 (spatial-peak, time-average), and the delivered acoustic energy density was 29.1 J/cm 2 . Sonicated cell sample preparation. Cell culture. HL-60 leukemia cells (CCL-240; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were chosen as the experimental cell line in this study. Owing to its intrinsic deficiency in pro-apoptotic regulatory proteins  34  , this immortal cell line was naturally more resistant against pro-apoptotic stress. Such property served well as an intrinsic control in our investigation of anti-proliferation effects  35  . The HL-60 cells were routinely cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (R8758; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (American Type Culture Collection). The cell culture incubator was kept at 37 \u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Cell density were constantly monitored to ensure that they did not exceed 10 6 cells/ml. As such, exponential cell growth can be maintained. HL-60 cells were sub-cultured every three days. During sub-culture, cells were harvested in a sterilized 15 ml centrifuge tube (BDAA352196; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Afterward, supernatants were removed and the harvested cells were resuspended with fresh RPMI medium. Addition of sonoporation tracer. Calcein (C481, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed as the exogenous, fluorescent sonoporation tracer to facilitate the sorting of sonoporated cells using flow cytometry. They were added to the cell suspension at a 10 \u00b5M concentration 10 min before cells were transferred to the cell chamber. Note that calcein (Ex: 495 nm/Em: 515 nm) is a 623 Da macromolecule with a radius of 0.65 nm, which is normally unable to permeate the cell membrane and remain extracellularly in the cell medium. Upon the occurrence of sonoporation, calcein would infiltrate the cell membrane via the perforated site and subsequently bind to cytoplasmic calcium ions, thereby resulting in the emission of green fluorescence from the cytoplasm of sonoporated cells. Hence, in our experiments, post-exposure intracellular presence of calcein fluorescence served well to indicate that sonoporation had occurred in that sonicated cell. Addition of microbubbles. Commercial microbubbles (USphere Prime; TRUST Bio-Sonics, Taiwan) were used as the artificial gas nuclei for acoustic cavitation to trigger sonoporation. These microbubbles comprised a perfluorobutane gas core that was encapsulated by a phospholipid shell. They had a mean diameter of 2.09 \u00b5m, and less than 1.7% of the population were larger than 5 \u00b5m according to the manufacturer's data. During experiments, microbubbles were added to the cell suspension 3 min before the ultrasound exposure at a cell-to-bubble ratio of 1:1. Note that the choice of cell-to-bubble ratio plays a significant role in the resulting sonoporation efficiency  20  . The 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio was empirically found to provide a balance between inducing substantial sonoporation (> 30%) and minimizing instant cell death (< 20%) in our previous studies  25, 27  . With this cell-tobubble ratio and the prescribed acoustic exposure parameters, over 99% of the supplemented microbubbles were found to have collapsed after the 30 s exposure, as observed under bright-field microscope. Delivery of ultrasound exposure. Before exposure, the cell suspension (supplemented with microbubbles and calcein) was filled into the ultrasound exposure platform's cell chamber, which was acoustically transparent and was sterilized beforehand  27  . The cell chamber was securely sealed after filling and was promptly placed at the middle panel of the exposure platform. Thereafter, ultrasound exposure was delivered as described in the previous subsection. After exposure, cells were immediately taken out from the cell chamber and were incubated for 5 min to allow sonoporated cells to reseal their perforation sites and, in turn, to restore the resistance against the uptake of exogeneous molecules. Note that the post-exposure incubation time was set based on previously published findings that showed membrane resealing to be typically taking place within 1 min after the onset of a resealable sonoporation episode  11  . Isolation of sonoporated cells. Labeling of non-viable cells. Following the post-exposure incubation period, sonicated cells were transferred to 5-ml sterile flow cytometry tubes (352054; BD Biosciences). After rinsing them twice with RPMI medium, they were stained for 15-min with 0.75 \u00b5M PI (P4170, Sigma-Aldrich) to label non-viable sonicated cells whose membrane remain compromised after the sonoporation episode and the 5 min post-exposure incubation period. Afterwards, cells were washed twice with PBS. Identification of cell subpopulations with flow cytometry. Identification of subpopulations was achieved through calcein/PI bivariate fluorescence analysis of the sonicated cell samples using a flow cytometer (Aria III, BD Biosciences). In each flow cytometry run, data for 10 4 cells per sample was acquired at a rate of 300 events/s. Also, calcein fluorescence was measured with a 530/30 nm filter, and PI fluorescence was detected with a 616/23 nm filter. Cells showing positive PI fluorescence were deemed to belong to the non-viable population, while those showing positive calcein fluorescence were deemed to belong to the sonoporated cell population. Accordingly, the bivariate flow cytometry analysis allowed us to identify subpopulations of viable sonoporated cells (PI-/ calcein +), viable unsonoprated cells (PI-/calcein-), and non-viable cells that may or may not be sonoporated (PI + /calcein + and PI + /calcein-). Our previous data showed that among a sonicated HL-60 cell population, 41.9% were viable sonoporated cells  27  . Cell sorting. Using the FACS functionality of the flow cytometer, viable sonoporated cells (SNP+) and viable unsonoporated cells (SNP-) were isolated by setting each subpopulation's gate fluorescence level according to the observed bivariate fluorescence distribution in the post-exposure cell population sample. Non-viable cells were excluded from this sorting process. From each sorting experiment, 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells for each targeted subpopulation were collected. Note that cells were sorted at a rate of 3000 events/s flow rate to ensure the targeted number of cells can be harvested efficiently within 30 min. During the cell sorting process, the sheath fluid of flow cytometer and the sample container were maintained at 4 \u00b0C to preserve cell viability  38  . The harvested cell populations were immediately re-incubated until the corresponding time points for conducting biological assays. Note that cells of the sham control group (CTL) and a sonicated cell group that received ultrasound exposure in the absence of microbubbles (US) also went through the identical cell sorting procedures.

Apoptosis and necrosis analysis. Apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed using the Annexin-V/PI bivariate fluorescence assay at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure according to the established protocol  39  . For each sorted cell sample, 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells were harvested and were washed with 4 \u00b0C PBS. The samples were then resuspended in binding buffer (1 \u00d7 HEPES buffer solution). After centrifugation and removal of supernatants, each cell population sample was incubated with 5 \u03bcl Annexin-V (A23202, Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate, Invitrogen) and 1 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/mL PI in a 100 \u03bcl binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min. Annexin-V binding served to label instances of phosphatidylserine externalization manifested in cells undergoing early apoptosis, whereas cytoplasmic presence of PI served to label cells with compromised membrane permeability that is well regarded as a shared feature of late apoptotic and necrotic cells  39  . Subsequently, 400 \u03bcl binding buffer was added to each sample on ice. Flow cytometry was then applied using fluorescence with Ex/Em of 346/440 nm laser for Annexin-V and Ex/Em of 488/625 nm for PI. The cell group was then displayed as scatter plots with horizontal and vertical axis representing Annexin-V and PI level respectively. From this analysis, three groups of cells could be identified: (a) early apoptotic cells (PI-/Annexin V +); (b) late apoptotic or necrotic cells (PI +); (c) viable cells (PI-/annexin-V-). Note that this protocol cannot identify dead cells that had already been lysed at a given post-exposure time as they were inevitably removed by centrifugation. Cell proliferation analysis. The CCK-8 colorimetric assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., MD, USA) was carried out to determine the number of viable cells at different post-exposure times. This assay was chosen in view of its low cytotoxicity to living cells and high sensitivity comparing with other proliferation assays such as MTT. In each experiment, a sorted cell subpopulation sample was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and was resuspended into the culture medium at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. The cell suspension was then transferred to a 96-well plate with 100 \u00b5l per well. Subsequently, 10 \u00b5l of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. The 96-well place was incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 to foster reaction. The plate was afterward transferred to a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go; Thermo Scientific Inc.) and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. In each experiment, calibration samples were prepared by inoculating 5 \u00d7 10 3 , 1 \u00d7 10 4 , 2 \u00d7 10 4 , 4 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well respectively with identical volume of 100 \u00b5l. Cell cycle analysis. The cell-cycle distribution at different time points was examined by fixing the cell subpopulation sample and analyzing the fixed cells' DNA contents via PI fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The sorted cell populations were extracted at 3 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after exposure and was fixed with 75% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C for further analysis. Before carrying out the cell-cycle analysis, the fixed samples were washed with PBS to remove the ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were stained with 0.5 ml of PI solution (75 mM) in the dark at room temperature. The fluorescence of the PI-stained cells was analyzed by a flow cytometer following the standard protocol  40  . Histograms of PI fluorescence, which represent distribution of cellular DNA contents instead of cell viability because cells were already fixed, were then formed from 10,000 cell counts for each sample. Cells at G 0 /G 1 -,S-and G 2 /M-phases were gated and quantified from the DNA histogram. HSP-70 expression analysis. qPCR analysis was conducted to evaluate the mRNA level of HSPA6, HASPA1A, HSPA1B in each sorted population at 3 h after exposure. The three genes were chosen as they encode the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) that serve a cytoprotective function in response to disturbance of cell homeostasis via chaperon regulation  26  . Prior to the analysis, 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells were harvested for each sample and the total RNA of the sample was isolated with the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. To verify the quality of the extracted RNA, a quantitative estimation was conducted with the Multiskan GO spectrophotometer, and its integrity was double confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The qPCR reaction mix was prepared using a SYBR Fast qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Cycling and gene expression detection was conducted with a real-time PCR system (ABI-7500; Applied Biosystems). The primers used in the experiments are listed in Table  2 . RNA quantity was normalized using GAPDH content, and gene expression was quantified according to the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method  41  . Statistical evaluation. For all conducted bioassays, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to the acquired measurements to evaluate whether there were statistically significant differences in the data samples between cell groups and between different post-exposure time points. This statistical evaluation task was conducted using OriginPro (ver. 9.0; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). Trends of statistical significance were identified as ones with p values of < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, which respectively correspond to confidence intervals of 95%, 99%, and 99.9%.  Figure 1 . 1 Figure1. Experimental protocol for investigating the downstream cellular impact of sonoporation. A calibrated acoustic exposure platform was used to deliver ultrasound pulses to cell samples at 0 min. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was then performed to isolate sonoporated cells (SNP+ group) and unsonoporated cells (SNP-group). The development trends of each sorted cell group were then assayed at different postexposure time points over a 24 h period.

Many specific mechanisms still need to be elucidated. For example, even though the concept of sonoporation has been originally conceived in the 1990s, its recovery mechanisms remain to be an obscurely described process as of today. Also, while acoustic cavitation is known to bring about mechanical impact of the cell membrane during sonoporation, the mechanosensitive signaling pathways involved in the process are still ill-defined and have lacked dedicated investigations. Even more, to push promising studies on sonoporation-mediated therapy closer to clinical applications, more considerations need to be highlighted for both clinical safety and therapy efficacy. It is well known that ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles are so sensitivity to acoustical exposures so that even the usage of diagnostic ultrasound may result in capillary rupture  [197] . The violent collapse of cavitation bubbles may induce extremely high strain that can even achieve histotripsy  [198] , while causing undesired damage to surrounding normal tissues. Thus, there are urgent demands for advanced developments of more efficient visualization guidance technique, standardized metrology of cavitation dosage, and real-time feedback control technology based on intraoperative quantity-effectiveness evaluation. In summary, future research still needs to be performed to fill these knowledge and technology gaps. The discovery of new biophysical mechanisms related to sonoporation would play an important role in establishing necessary knowledge for rationalizing the use of sonoporation in biomedicine. In the context of drug and gene delivery, such effort would serve well to enhance the efficiency of drug uptake by the treatment target, thereby improving the treatment outcome. Recognizing that ultrasound can be concurrently used for imaging purposes, rational realization of ultrasound-mediated drug delivery will significantly bolster endeavors that seek to develop ultrasound into an effective theranostic paradigm for biomedical applications.

To provide insight into these processes, this article presents a new series of direct evidence on the membrane-level dynamics during and after an episode of sonoporation. Our direct observations were obtained from anchored fetal fibroblasts whose membrane topography was imaged in situ using real-time confocal microscopy. To facilitate controlled sonoporation at the single-cell level, microbubbles that can passively adhere to the cell membrane were first introduced at a 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio. Single-pulse ultrasound exposure (1-MHz frequency, 10-cycle pulse duration, 0.85-MPa peak negative pressure in situ) was then applied to trigger microbubble pulsation/collapse, which, in turn, instigated membrane perforation. With this protocol, five membrane-level phenomena were observed: (i) localized perforation of the cell membrane was synchronized with the instant of ultrasound pulsing; (ii) perforation sites with temporal peak area ,30 mm 2 were resealed successfully; (iii) during recovery, a thickened pore rim emerged, and its temporal progression corresponded with the pore closure action; (iv) membrane resealing, if successful, would generally be completed within 1 min of the onset of sonoporation, and the resealing time constant was estimated to be below 20 s; (v) membrane resealing would fail for overly large pores (.100 mm 2 ) or in the absence of extracellular calcium ions.

As highlighted in numerous reviews  (Geers et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2010; Nomikou and McHale 2010; Pua and Zhong 2009) , this way of achieving membrane perforation (often referred to as sonoporation) holds strong potential in enhancing the delivery of large drug molecules and gene plasmids into a cell to induce therapeutic effects. Compared with other membrane perforation approaches, sonoporation is perhaps unique in that spatiotemporal control can be readily exercised. In particular, spatial localization of sonoporation may be realized by introducing synthetic microbubbles as sonoporation agents in the vicinity of cells  (Hernot and Klibanov 2008; Liu et al. 2006; Suzuki et al. 2011) . As well, temporal specificity may be achieved in sonoporation by commanding the time of ultrasound application to controllably instigate microbubble pulsation or collapse (corresponding to stable or inertial cavitation, respectively) that generates the mechanical force required for membrane puncturing  (Ferrara et al. 2007) . To complement the strong efforts to develop sonoporation-based therapeutic applications, it is vital to establish the details of fundamental biophysical processes involved in sonoporation. Of significant relevance are two membrane-level processes that epitomize the notion of sonoporation: (i) how membrane perforation is induced by ultrasound-microbubble interactions, and (ii) how the membrane remodels itself after an episode of sonoporation. Acquiring direct observation of these processes is, however, not a straightforward task. Although high-resolution images of sonoporated cells can be obtained using advanced techniques such as atomic force microscopy  (Duvshani-Eshet et al. 2006; Prentice et al. 2005; Ross et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2008)  and electron microscopy  (Mehier-Humbert et al. 2005; Schlicher et al. 2006 Schlicher et al. , 2010;; Qiu et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2008 ), these approaches are not suitable for examining the temporal dynamics of sonoporation. Also, even though voltage clamping may be used to examine transmembranous ion kinetics related to sonoporation at fine temporal resolution  (Deng et al. 2004; Pan et al. 2005; Tran et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2008) , this technique inherently cannot provide image-level information. Alternatively, ultrafast optical microscopy has frequently been leveraged to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of microbubble-cell interactions over the course of acoustic cavitation  (Kudo et al. 2009; Ohl et al. 2006; Nejad et al. 2011; Sankin et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2012) . However, to examine the details of membrane dynamics (especially during post-sonoporation recovery), optical image contrast seems to be mediocre if not inadequate. In the investigation described here, we sought to acquire the first series of direct observations on the time-course dynamics of perforation sites in microbubble-mediated sonoporation. Our overall postulate was that, to gain detailed insight into how perforation and recovery take place in sonoporation, it is essential to unravel the time-varying surface topography of sonoporated cell membrane in situ. In approaching this task, we surmised that real-time confocal fluorescence microscopy, if coupled to a well-characterized acoustic exposure apparatus, is a suitable experimental methodology because it offers both high imaging contrast (via specific labeling of cell membrane) and sufficient temporal resolution (needed to render membrane dynamics over the course of sonoporation). Note that real-time fluorescence imaging was previously introduced in other sonoporation studies to examine subcellular events such as calcium ion influxes  (Fan et al. 2010; Juffermans et al. 2009; Kumon et al. 2009; Park et al. 2010 ) and trans-membranous diffusion of fluorescent markers  (Fan et al. 2012; Kooiman et al. 2011; Meijering et al. 2009; van Ruijssevelt et al. 2013) . Fixed-cell confocal microscopy of sonoporated cell morphology has also been reported  (Schlicher et al. 2006 (Schlicher et al. , 2010)) . In contrast, here our aim was to leverage real-time confocal microscopy to elucidate the time course of membrane perforation and recovery in sonoporation. This sequence of membrane-level events has yet to be convincingly observed in situ.

The real-time cell membrane imaging platform used in this work was a composite apparatus that coupled an ultrasound transmission module to a laser scanning confocal microscopy system  (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) . As illustrated in Figure  1a , the singleelement piston transducer (1-MHz frequency, 25.4-mm diameter; Wuxi Beisheng Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China) of the ultrasound module was driven by a twostage electronics setup that was an arbitrary waveform generator for pulse shape programming (33120A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a 50-dB broadband amplifier (2100L, Electronics & Innovation, Rochester, NY, USA). The nose cone-shaped acrylic waveguide, on which the ultrasound transducer was mounted, was a custom-designed device with 75 mm height and 8 mm nose diameter. Cell chamber. The cell chamber used for experimentation was an in-house design, and a top view of it is shown in the lower left inset of Figure  1a . Modified from a 50 mm-diameter polystyrene dish with 1-mm-thick base  (150288, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) , this chamber housed a 20 3 28-mm 2 observation window within which cells were seeded. The window was created by carving out that particular segment of the polystyrene dish and sealing the base of the resulting void with a cover glass less than 160 mm thick (Type 1, Vitromed, Basel, Switzerland). Note that for 1-MHz ultrasound, the wavelength of which was approximately 1.5 mm in water-solvent solutions, the cover glass can be assumed to be an acoustically thin layer. Platform alignment. A 4-mm detachable tip was included at the nose of the waveguide to facilitate physical alignment between the waveguide, the microscope's scan plane and the cell chamber. The alignment was realized by placing the tip in contact with the base of the cell chamber's observation window and positioning it at the center of the microscope's field of view. This process was visually guided by observing through the microscope's eyepiece. To avoid interfering with the microscope's bright-field imaging operations, the waveguide was angled at 40 with respect to the surface normal of the cell chamber. After the alignment was completed, the 4-mm tip was detached from the nose of the waveguide.

MRC-5 fetal fibroblasts (CCL-171, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were used as our cell model. It is a commonly used cell line in transdermal drug delivery. The cells were first cultured in monolayer form inside a culture flask using minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco 41500-018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SV30160.03, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco 11840-030, Invitrogen). Throughout the culturing, the cells were placed inside a 37 C incubator environment with 5% carbon dioxide. Before the experiment, the fibroblasts were harvested by trypsinizing the cells. The working density of the harvested cell extract was 150,000 cells/mL, as determined with a hemocytometer. Cell seeding within cell chamber. The harvested fibroblasts were seeded onto the cover glass of the cell chamber as follows. First, as illustrated in Figure  1b  (Step 1), a polystyrene coverslip was patched onto the upper side of the cell chamber's observation window to create a temporary enclosure. The coverslip was securesealed on three sides of the window, and a 1-mm gap was left open on the remaining side to serve as an injection port for substance transfer. After that, 0.6 mL of the trypsinized fibroblast extract (i.e., around 90,000 cells) was pipetted into the enclosure. Their attachment to the bottom cover glass was fostered by adding 5 mL of fresh MEM to the cell chamber and placing it inside the incubator for 24 h (Fig.  1b,  Step 2). Membrane labeling. After cell attachment to the cover glass, the cell chamber's MEM was replaced with a staining solution to fluorescently label the cell membrane (Fig.  1b,  Step 3). In this work, CellMask Orange (C10045, Invitrogen; absorption maximum: 554 nm, emission maximum: 567 nm) was used to stain membrane phospho-lipids at a working concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The dye was dissolved in a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer (pH 7.4) containing 137 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 5.4 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 0.25 mM sodium phosphate, 0.44 mM potassium phosphate, 1.3 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 4.2 mM sodium bicarbonate and 20 mM HEPES (4-[2hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid). Note that this particular dye was chosen for our investigation in view of its slow internalization rate-an important characteristic for maintaining high membrane labeling specificity without running the risk of co-labeling subcellular organelles. The staining reaction was allowed to take place for 15 min in a dark environment, after which the enclosure was gently washed with HBSS. Microbubble supplementation. To provide artificial nucleation sites for instigation of sonoporation during ultrasound exposure, lipid-shelled microbubbles were injected into the observation window after cell membrane staining (Fig.  1b, Step 4 ). Targestar P commercial-grade microbubbles (TS-108, Targeson, San Diego, CA, USA) were used in this work; they had an average diameter of 2.2 mm, with less than 1.7% of the microbubble population larger than 5 mm. The microbubbles were added at a density of 150,000 bubbles/mL, and thus, the average cell-to-bubble ratio was approximately 1:1. To facilitate microbubble adhesion to the apical surface of the cell, the cell chamber was flipped upside down for 15 min (Fig.  1b,  Step 5), so as to allow buoyant forces to lift the microbubbles toward the anchored fibroblasts. The cell chamber was then gently reverted to its original upright position. Subsequently, the temporary enclosure of the observation window was removed by using forceps to take away the polystyrene coverslip (Fig.  1b , Step 6), and the cell chamber was gently filled with HBSS to a working volume of 25 mL. The cell chamber was placed onto our customized imaging platform within 10 min for experimentation. Extracellular calcium ion depletion. To gain comparative insight into post-sonoporation membrane recovery dynamics, an experiment was conducted in the absence of extracellular calcium ions (Ca 21 ), which are known to play an active role in membrane recovery processes. For this experiment, the cell loading procedure was the same as for the other experiments, except that a Ca 21 -free HBSS buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 3 mM magnesium chloride and 20 mM HEPES was used as the cell chamber buffer after staining. Also, 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (E-3889, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) extracellular Ca 21 chelators were added to the buffer solution to inactivate Ca 21 externalized from the cell due to intrinsic ion transport. Note that for this experiment, a 5-min wait period was allowed after the addition of Ca 21 -free buffer for the chelation reaction to take effect before exposure.

For this investigation, a shortduration pulse waveform was used (generated using arbitrary waveform generator). The waveform's center frequency was 1 MHz (i.e., in line with the transducer's center frequency), and the pulse length was set to be 10 cycles. These settings yielded a pulse duration of 10 ms. Pulse triggering was carried out manually during experimentation to facilitate single-pulse ultrasound activation of microbubble pulsation or collapse. The waveform amplitude was adjusted to a level that corresponded to a nominal peak negative pressure of 0.85 MPa, as calibrated by hydrophone measurements described below. This pressure value, well considered to be within the typical levels used in imaging diagnostics  (Humphrey 2007) , was chosen so as not to trigger cavitational activities in a microbubble-free medium. Field calibrations. To characterize the acoustic exposure conditions in situ, free-field mapping of the peak negative pressure in front of the waveguide (with tip detached) was performed inside a 37 C water bath using a needle hydrophone (HNR-0500, ONDA, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) that was facing the nose of the wave-guide. Note that the needle hydrophone was mounted onto a three-axis scan stage (ASTS-01, ONDA) to facilitate high-precision positioning. Also, to avoid needle tip contact, the hydrophone holder included an ad hoc guard rail in the form of a wooden straw whose length was 1 mm longer than the needle hydrophone. In other words, all field measurements were conducted at a minimum distance of 1 mm from the nose of the waveguide. As illustrated in Figure  2a  (xz-plane map), the axial maximum of the free-field peak negative pressure was approximately 4 mm away from the waveguide nose. Because this value was rather close to the physical length of the detachable waveguide tip, the pressure magnitude at the free-field axial maximum can be inferred as the incident level of ultrasound field impinging on the cell chamber. Figure  2b  shows the single-pulse waveform detected by the hydrophone at the free-field axial maximum. The peak negative pressure was found to be 0.85 MPa. This value was regarded as the nominal peak negative pressure in our investigation. To examine the homogeneity of incident ultrasound field along the surface of the cell chamber, 40 -angle cross-sectional mapping of the peak negative pressure was carried out at the free-field axial maximum. As illustrated in Figure  2a  (xy-plane map), the 150 3 150-mm 2 area (marked by the dashed box) corresponding to the largest scan plane size used in this work only had limited variations (1%) in the free-field peak negative pressure. Note that standing waves (with pressure anti-nodes up to twice the free-field value) would inevitably emerge in situ because of the strong acoustic reflection at the base of our cell chamber, which was essentially interfaced with the microscope's lens. Nevertheless, we restrained the confounding effect of these standing waves on our experimental results by using a single short ultrasound pulse (10 cycles) to instigate cavitational activity. Indeed, this uncertainty in the in situ acoustic pressure would not affect the validity of our findings because all our observations were directly attributed to episodes of microbubble pulsation or collapse.

To elicit the fluorescence of cell membrane (stained by the CellMask Orange dye), a laser excitation wavelength of 543 nm was used; for signal detection, a reception band of 555-643 nm was used. A 403 oil lens (420461-9910, Carl Zeiss) was used for image capture. It had a numerical aperture of 1.3 and a refractive index of 1.518. As discussed in the Results section, the confocal microscope's pinhole size, pixel dwell time and image size were varied to adjust the frame rate of planar raster scans as necessary to image membrane perforation (a fast membrane Scan configurations. In this work, the scan plane positions were set to correspond to the apical and basal surfaces of the cell so as to monitor membrane dynamics adjacent to and away from the microbubble (adhered to the apical side). In addition to performing planar scans of the cell, single-line scans were conducted to capture the fast-changing temporal dynamics of the membrane along one line of interest along an image plane. Moreover, bright-field images were acquired in parallel to locate the microbubble position in situ. Cine loops were then formed to visualize the time-course dynamics of membrane-level processes in sonoporation. Data analysis. Image frames were imported into Im-ageJ (Version 1.47n, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) for quantitative analysis of sonoporation features. Specifically, the pore area and its long-axis diameter were measured for multiple episodes of sonoporation (N 5 7) by demarcating the pore contour in each frame and measuring the contour size. A time profile of these measures was formed correspondingly, and temporal-peak values were identified. Using the GraphPad Prism software (Version 5, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), pore measurements for cells with successful resealing were statistically compared against those that failed to reseal (based on the Student t-test). Also, saturation growth regression was performed to estimate the perforation time constant for each episode of sonoporation (between the onset of pore formation and the instant when pore area reached a maximum). To quantify recovery dynamics after sonoporation, the post-resealing scar area was gauged as similar to the pore size measurements. As well, the resealing time constant was estimated through an exponential decay regression (from the instant at which pore area reached a maximum to the time point of pore closure). The time constants and observed resealing outcomes (success or failure) were correlated against temporal-peak pore area using Spearman's nonparametric analysis to determine their relationship.

The exact position of this field of view is depicted in Figure  3 , which also provides a time series image set of the perforation site. Three salient observations can be noted from Supplementary Video 1 and Figure  3 : (i) pore creation was synchronized with the time course of microbubble collapse; (ii) the resulting pore size (5.3-mm long-axis diameter) was greater than the microbubble size (1.8-mm diameter); (iii) membrane resealing commenced within 5 s after the incidence of sonoporation and was completed within 1 min. It should be emphasized that the perforation process was confined to a local region of the cell membrane. Indeed, the size of the perforation site was much smaller than the fibroblast's dimensions (length 5 142.5 mm, width 5 49.5 mm).

To further exemplify this observation, we conducted a single-line scan of the membrane dynamics at a temporal resolution of 1 ms. As shown in Figure  6 , the scan line was placed across the microbubble to capture the correspondence between the onset of microbubble collapse and membrane perforation. In this case, before exposure to ultrasound, the microbubble had a diameter of 1.4 mm. At the time of ultrasound pulsing, the microbubble collapsed immediately, and the membrane was perforated concurrently. Note that 1 ms after ultrasound pulsing, pore size was measured to be 3.3 mm, which was 2.4 times greater than the microbubble size. As such, it can be inferred that a blasting effect was generated on the cell membrane by the ultrasound-induced microbubble collapse. Additional insight into the rapid nature of membrane perforation can be gained from Figure  7a , in which time traces of the measured pore area are plotted for seven sonoporation episodes induced using our single microbubble-mediated approach. As can be observed, the first 5 s after the onset of perforation was generally the time window in which the pore would expand rapidly toward its maximum size. Indeed, except for one case (the uppermost curve in Fig.  7a ), the pore stopped expanding within 12 s after sonoporation. The perforation time constant, as determined from saturation growth regression analysis, was found to be generally below 5 s, except for the outlier case mentioned (see box-whisker plot given in Fig.  7b , left box). Note that no statistically significant correlation (r 5 0.4286) was found between the perforation time constant and temporal-peak pore area. Membrane recovery: Tens of seconds in duration and a multi-faceted process Resealing of the perforation site generally commenced within 10 s after the onset of perforation. As shown in the time traces of Figure  7a , the time from the instant at which pore size reached a maximum to the completion of pore closure was generally on the order of tens of seconds. For the seven sonoporation episodes, their resealing time constant derived from an exponential decay regression analysis was found to range between 6 and 20 s (see Fig.  7b , right box). This time constant was statistically correlated (r 5 0.8571, p , 0.05) with temporalpeak pore area for a particular episode of sonoporation. Such a correlation is after all expected because it is reasonable for larger pores to require a longer time to reseal. The course of action involved in post-sonoporation resealing was found to be rather multi-faceted from a biological standpoint. As can be noted from Supplementary Video 1 as well as Figures  3  and 5 , during the recovery stage, the rim of the disrupted membrane exhibited a stronger fluorescence level, which indicates a local increase in phospholipid content. Also, after membrane resealing was completed, the original perforation site exhibited strong fluorescence, and this area was measured to be on the same order as the temporal-peak pore area (see Fig.  4a , middle box). These observations suggest that post-sonoporation scarring of the membrane may emerge. Another observation of interest is that, although membrane perforation induced by ultrasound-triggered microbubble collapse or pulsation was localized, other segments of the cell membrane may be disrupted over the process. In particular, away from the perforation site, the membrane exhibited a striated pattern postexposure that was not observed pre-exposure. Indeed, as shown in Figures  3b  and 5b , such a membrane striation pattern was evident over the surface of the entire sonoporated cell.

Evidence of this phenomenon is given in Supplementary Video 2, which features a cine loop of how a sonoporated cell has not resealed its perforation site after 6 min into the sonoporation episode (frame period: 3 s). Indeed, a time-lapse enlargement of the pore was apparent starting 10 s after the onset of sonoporation, and this process lasted until 3.5 min into the episode, after which the pore slowly began to undergo resealing. A still-frame rendering of this observation is provided in Figure  8 . Note that the apical pore was measured to be 32.6 mm in long-axis diameter (generated by ultrasound-triggered collapse of a 1.5-mm-diameter microbubble). Another point worth noting in this example is that in addition to excessive puncturing on the apical surface of the cell, mild but reversible membrane tearing on the basal side of the cell can also be observed. The maximum size of the basal tear was 12.5 mm, a value that is in line with our microbubble pulsation-induced membrane tear shown in Figure  5 . Such a difference between apical and basal pore sizes may help explain why the apical pore has not resealed, even 30 min after exposure. To characterize the relationship between resealing outcome and pore size, seven different episodes of sonoporation with failed resealing were identified, and their temporal-peak pore area and long-axis diameter were measured. Compared to cases with successful resealing, sonoporated cells that failed to reseal exhibited a substantially larger pore area that was one order of magnitude higher (see Fig.  4a , right box). Also, the long-axis pore diameters in these cases were all larger than 10 mm (see Fig.  4b , right box). These results indicate a strong correlation between pore size and failure of post-sonoporation resealing, and this was statistically confirmed through a Spearman's rank correlation analysis that examined the size distribution of both resealable pores and nonresealed ones (r 5 0.8603, p , 0.001).

In line with this objective, our real-time cine loops have provided a direct visualization of how the onset of plasma membrane perforation is synchronized with a cavitating microbubble (Supplementary Video 1). These direct observations reveal that sonoporation can be realized by a microbubble undergoing physical collapse (inertial cavitation; see Fig.  3 ) or non-collapsing pulsation (stable cavitation; see Fig.  5 ). They also illustrate how membrane resealing, if successful, would typically be completed within 1 min after the onset of sonoporation (Fig.  6 ). This latter finding is especially relevant to underscoring the prevailing perception that sonoporation is a transitory phenomenon  (Liang et al. 2010) . Further analysis of our imaging observations allowed us to gain quantitative insight into the dynamics of perforation and resealing in sonoporation. Temporal-peak pore area was found to be a key factor influencing resealing outcome (Fig.  4 ) and recovery duration (Fig.  7 ). To our knowledge, this investigation represents the first demonstration of the temporal course of membrane-level events involved in sonoporation. It can in essence be considered an effort to acquire new epitomizing evidence on the spatiotemporal dynamics of sonoporation. It is uniquely positioned between previous observations that have revealed phenomena either upstream or downstream of the actual perforation process. For instance, our results are distinguished from upstream findings that illustrate how cavitation-induced jetting would lead to membrane puncturing  (Ohl et al. 2006) , as well as how the extent of membrane effect can be modulated by controlling the microbubble's distance from the membrane  (Zhou et al. 2012) .

In particular, we found that membrane resealing is not necessarily a definite process that is always executed successfully. In cases where pore size was excessive, the sonoporated membrane was observed to remain perforated 30 min into the onset of sonoporation (Supplementary Video 2 and Fig.  8 ). Also, for post-sonoporation resealing to be initiated, the presence of extracellular Ca 21 is vital (Supplementary Video 3 and Fig.  9 ). On the basis of these findings, it can be readily deduced that membrane resealing is inherently a complex process that depends on various biophysical factors. Our direct observations have also provided new clues to the course of action involved in post-sonoporation membrane resealing. One common topographic feature of sonoporated cells undergoing membrane resealing is the emergence of a thickened rim at the perforation site  (Figs. 3, 5 and 8) . The temporal progression of this rim was found to correspond to the pore closure action. Regardless of whether membrane integrity is ultimately restored, pore rim thickening is likely to be an essential feature of membrane resealing because such a feature is not present when the resealing process is inhibited via extracellular Ca 21 depletion (Fig.  8 ). On review of the cell biology literature, we found that this feature is essentially similar in appearance to the concentric zones of actin and myosin observed in recovering single-cell wounds  (Benink and Bement 2005) . As actin and myosin are essentially components of a cell's cytoskeleton, it may well be possible that post-sonoporation membrane resealing is a cytoskeleton-dependent process. Two other recovery-related membrane features of our results are worth noting: (i) scarring of successfully resealed perforation sites, and (ii) striation of the membrane surface away from the perforation site (Figs.  3  and 5 ). The first feature may be attributed to the closure action of the thickened rim, or it may be the result of other mechanisms such as exocytotic patching of intracellular vesicles and organelles that are also rich in phospholipids  (Sonnemann and Bement 2011) . Explanation of the second feature would require a more detailed analysis of the cell's cytomechanical balance after sonoporation. It may well be possible that the cytoskeleton, which plays a central role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell, is directly involved in eliciting the membrane striation patterns.

Although such an assumption is not invalid, it inherently omits membrane-level dynamics, which are important from a biophysical perspective. To gain insight into this topic, we devised a customized ultrasound exposure platform with real-time confocal microscopy capabilities to acquire new direct evidence of how, at the single-cell level, membrane perforation typically occurs in an episode of single microbubble collapse triggered by a single ultrasound pulse. In addition, we directly observed how post-sonoporation membrane recovery takes place in situ. Taken together, these experimental findings serve well to highlight the transitory nature of sonoporation at the membrane level. We anticipate that our series of direct observations presented here can serve as mechanistic motivation for further efforts that seek to optimize the realization of sonoporation from a more biologically centered perspective in which the biophysical pathways involved in membrane perforation are taken into account.

However, for this perforation approach (sonoporation), the recovery manoeuvres invoked by the cell are unknown. Here, we report new findings on how membrane blebbing can be a recovery manoeuvre that may take place in sonoporation episodes whose pores are of micrometres in diameter. Each sonoporation site was created using a protocol involving single-shot ultrasound exposure (frequency: 1 MHz; pulse length: 30 cycles; peak negative pressure: 0.45 MPa) which triggered inertial cavitation of a single targeted microbubble (diameter: 1-5 mm). Over this process, live confocal microscopy was conducted in situ to monitor membrane dynamics, model drug uptake kinetics and cytoplasmic calcium ion (Ca 2\u00fe ) distribution. Results show that blebbing would occur at a recovering sonoporation site after its resealing, and it may emerge elsewhere along the membrane periphery. The bleb size was correlated with the pre-exposure microbubble diameter, and 99% of blebbing cases at sonoporation sites were inflicted by microbubbles larger than 1.5 mm diameter (analysed over 124 sonoporation episodes). Blebs were not observed at irreversible sonoporation sites or when sonoporation site repair was inhibited via extracellular Ca 2\u00fe chelation. Functionally, the bleb volume was found to serve as a buffer compartment to accommodate the cytoplasmic Ca 2\u00fe excess brought about by Ca 2\u00fe influx during sonoporation.

In fostering localized induction of sonoporation, one technical advance that has played an important role is the advent of targeted microbubbles with binding affinity to antigen receptors on the cell type of interest  [8, 9] , such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors expressed on cancerous cells  [10]  or hypoxic endothelial cells  [11] . These targeted microbubbles, often composed of a perfluorocarbon gas core encapsulated within an antibody-conjugated shell material  [12] , are in effect artificial gas bodies that would cavitate in response to ultrasound excitation, which could be as short as a single pulse firing  [13] . As their binding is known to persist under shear-flow conditions  [14, 15] , they can effectively reside adjacent to the plasma membrane to locally induce membrane disruption over their course of acoustic cavitation  [16, 17]  and concurrently release drugs which may be preloaded onto the microbubble shell  [18] . & 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Alas, amid the technical advances in targeted microbubble design that enabled controlled instigation of sonoporation, the biophysical details involved in this process have remained vaguely understood. At issue is the lack of knowledge on how a cell seeks to recover from sonoporation episodes  [19, 20] , especially those that were triggered locally by the cavitation of microbubbles bordering the plasma membrane. This issue is after all of crucial relevance to the survival of sonoporated cells. Previous findings have reported instances of membrane morphology alterations in cells that were subjected to acoustic cavitation exposure  [21 -24] , but the constitutive processes leading to these alterations have yet to be identified. Perhaps two recovery manoeuvres that may take place during sonoporation are endocytosis-mediated membrane reunion and exocytosismediated vesicular patching  [25] . The former is suggested to be applicable to nanometre-sized pores  [26] , while the latter is often invoked in cases with acute calcium ion (Ca 2\u00fe ) influx  [27] , which would indeed arise during sonoporation  [28, 29] . However, the caveat in solely relying on these two manoeuvres to underscore the recovery phase of sonoporation is that they cannot serve to explain why significant membrane protrusions were observed in some sonoporated cells  [23] . As such, it is conceivable that other forms of morphological remodelling events would take place as a sonoporated cell seeks to repair the cavitation-induced physical discontinuities on its plasma membrane. In this article, we report new insights into the recovery dynamics in sonoporation by demonstrating membrane blebbing as a possible action in which a sonoporated cell may undertake in its stride to restore plasma membrane integrity. Specifically, our investigation has sought to establish the causality between: (i) individual, site-specific sonoporation episodes induced by ultrasound-triggered collapse of a single targeted microbubble (a terminal feature of inertial cavitation) attached to the plasma membrane and (ii) emergence of blebs at the recovering sonoporation site and at other parts of the plasma membrane. In hypothesizing that blebbing is a sonoporation-related membrane remodelling event, our rationale was twofold. First, as blebs are essentially local herniations on the membrane  [30, 31] , they are seemingly in close resemblance to the protrusive membrane blisters observed in some sonoporated cells  [23] . Second, it is recognized that acute disruption of the actin cytoskeleton would favour bleb formation  [32] , and such disruption would indeed take place during microbubble-mediated sonoporation  [33] . Taken together, it is plausible that blebbing may occur as a reactionary manoeuvre in sonoporation episodes, particularly since reparable sonoporation sites can be a few micrometres in size  [34]  and passive membrane reunion is known to falter under this circumstance  [35] . Note that, from a cell biology standpoint, blebbing has conventionally been associated with cell locomotion and cell death  [30] [31] [32] , but recent evidence has shown that this manoeuvre is equally important in helping wounded cells avoid immediate lysis when they were nonspecifically attacked by pore-forming toxins  [36] . Taking into account the latter notion, we surmise that observing a similar phenomenon in sonoporation is after all not peculiar. Indeed, our current investigation would serve to substantiate the prorecovery nature of membrane blebbing by providing novel direct observations of bleb formation at recovering membrane wounds that were physically instigated on a site-specific basis via sonoporation.

Ultrasound pulses emitted from the ultrasound exposure apparatus were passed into a leg-shaped acrylic waveguide that served as a collimating device (1.5 mm wall thickness, 70 mm leg length, 408 leg angle), and the collimated pulses were in turn emitted through the waveguide's cuboid foot base. Placed in contact with the waveguide base was a cassette-shaped cell chamber, whose bottom interface was an acoustically thin glass coverslip (0.13 mm thick) with an enumerated grid (1 \u00c2 1 mm box resolution) as a guide for in situ tracking of cell location.

At this pressure level, the targeted microbubbles that we introduced as localized sonoporation agents (details to be described later) would generally collapse for our given applied pulse.

In particular, the following parameters were measured using built-in functions in IMAGEJ: (i) pre-exposure microbubble diameter (based on bright-field signature); (ii) temporal-peak pore diameter (by measuring the gap length of membrane periphery disruption as highlighted by CellMask); (iii) bleb volume at the sonoporation site (from measuring the bleb size in the three-dimensional confocal image volume). Pearson correlation analysis was carried out on these measurements to assess the relationships between: (i) microbubble diameter and bleb volume (association between sonoporation and membrane blebbing); (ii) microbubble diameter and pore diameter (association between the instigation of sonoporation episodes and the size of sonoporation sites). In addition, using the 124 sonoporation episodes in which single-plane membrane dynamics data were available, we tallied the number of occurrences of sonoporation-induced blebbing for different microbubble size groups (eight groups spanning between 1 and 5 mm; each with 0.5 mm range).

Electronic supplementary material, movie S1, shows a representative scenario obtained from a group of six breast carcinoma cells. In this cine loop, the temporal dynamics of the membrane periphery (CellMask fluorescence) of the six cells were tracked from 5 s before exposure to 15 min after exposure. Selected frames of this field of view at various time points are shown in figure  2 . As a background observation, it can be noted that adjacent to the pre-exposure microbubble position (present on Cells 1 to 4; see figure  2a ), abrupt perturbation of the membrane periphery and localized entry of Sytox-Green (green fluorescence) into the cytoplasm were both apparent immediately after single-shot ultrasound exposure (figure  2b, c ). These phenomena represent strong indications that sonoporation have been instigated locally at those places. In electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure  2 , key observations on sonoporation-induced membrane blebbing can be noted from Cells 1, 2 and 3, each of which had a single targeted microbubble attached to their membrane before ultrasound exposure. In particular, after the respective sonoporation site of these cells had restored its membrane integrity (within 1 min), a bleb in the form of local membrane herniation had emerged shortly thereafter (indicated by white arrows in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure  2c, d ). Furthermore, secondary blebs away from the sonoporation site had also emerged at other locations along the cell periphery (see light-blue arrows in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure  2d-h ). It should be emphasized that this phenomenon is specific to sonoporation episodes with successful resealing, because such blebs were not found in Cell 4 whose membrane integrity was irreversibly sonoporated by ultrasound-triggered collapse of two targeted microbubbles attached to its membrane ( permanent membrane damage was concurrently indicated by the incessant Sytox-Green uptake). Note that the blebs were also not observed in Cells 5 and 6 (with no microbubbles attached) that remained unsonoporated and intact following ultrasound exposure. rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R.

Similar to Cells 1 to 3 shown in figure  2 , membrane disruption can be observed in the cell shown in electronic supplementary material, movie S3, immediately after single-shot ultrasound exposure (see also figure  6b ). Over this process, Ca 2\u00fe influx was evident as indicated by the significant increase in cytoplasmic Fluo4-AM fluorescence (figure  6b-d ), and it is after all expected as Ca 2\u00fe influx is known to take place during sonoporation  [28, 29] . When membrane blebbing began to emerge at the sonoporation site and elsewhere along the membrane periphery (starting at around 20 s after ultrasound pulsing; see white arrows in figure  6e ), two observations of interest regarding intracellular Ca 2\u00fe dynamics can be noted. First, intracellular Ca 2\u00fe had concurrently filled the resulting bleb volume, as reflected by the high local Fluo4-AM fluorescence    6e, f  ). Second, over the course of time, the intra-bleb Ca 2\u00fe level had seemingly dissipated at a rate similar to the cytoplasmic Ca 2\u00fe level.

Sonoporation-induced membrane blebbing: summative recap How cells strive to restore plasma membrane integrity in a sonoporation episode is an important question that has remained unanswered hitherto. While direct observations of sonoporation site closure have been reported  [34] , the mechanistic steps involved in the process are still unknown with the exception of a few hypotheses based on site patching and membrane self-reunion arguments  [25] . In this work, we have gained insight into the recovery dynamics in sonoporation episodes that were generated by inertial cavitation of targeted microbubbles. Central to our investigation is the use of a previously established experimental protocol that allowed us to identify the in situ position of sonoporation sites via the tracking of the pre-exposure targeted microbubble location  [33] . Using this protocol, a new series of direct observations has been acquired on possible membrane-level events that may take place at sonoporation sites after their resealing. Results have generally illustrated that membrane blebbing in the form of physical herniations may emerge in the recovery phase of sonoporation episodes. At a single-cell level, a number of salient findings are worth highlighting in our experiments. First, blebbing was found to occur at the sonoporation site after its initial resealing, and it may also emerge at other places along the membrane periphery (Cells 1 to 3 in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure  2 ). This morphological feature may well explain why physical protrusions may arise on the membrane of cells that were exposed to acoustic cavitation instigated on a non-specific basis  [23] . Another finding to be noted is that membrane blebbing was seemingly specific to sonoporation sites that could undergo successful repair, as irreversibly punctured sites (Cell 4 in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure  2 ) and inhibition of sonoporation site repair via extracellular Ca 2\u00fe chelation (electronic supplementary material, movie S2, and figure  3 ) had both suppressed bleb formation. Correspondingly, it can be inferred that blebbing is after all related to a cell's recovery manoeuvre during a sonoporation episode. In terms of the size of sonoporation-induced membrane blebs, which are essentially volumetric in nature (figure  4 ), it was generally found to be correlated with the size of the microbubble responsible for inflicting the sonoporation episode (figure  5a ). Also, over 124 sonoporation episodes, most of the blebbing cases (99%) were seemingly inflicted by microbubbles larger than 1.5 mm diameter (table  1 ). This trend suggests that blebbing is more likely to form at large sonoporation sites (up to 6.8 mm pore diameter in our experiments; figure  5b ).

From a biophysical perspective, this phenomenon may be attributed to two factors. The first pertains to the cytostructural dynamics of a sonoporated cell. It is known that, when sonoporation is instigated, there is concomitant rupturing of the actin cytoskeleton network that is physically interconnected with the plasma membrane  [33] . Although membrane integrity may be restored within tens of seconds, actin disassembly may persist, and this would promote an increase in the local hydrostatic pressure because of the resulting sparser cytoskeleton scaffold  [30] [31] [32] . Consequently, the membrane of the newly resealed sonoporation rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 12: 20150029 site would reactively be pinched outward in attempt to restore pressure equilibrium. Note that sonoporation-induced actin network disruption may not necessarily be a localized phenomenon and may propagate to the entire cell over time  [33] . As such, it is not unreasonable to expect that secondary blebs may emerge at other places along a sonoporated cell's membrane periphery (i.e. away from the sonoporation site). We postulate that the second factor as to why sonoporationinduced membrane blebbing may take place is because of the activation of a cytoprotective response. As reported in the cell biology literature, blebbing is a manoeuvre that may help an injured cell resist against immediate lysis  [36] . Our experiments have suggested that the intra-bleb volume, which is essentially created through an outward pinching of the membrane, would fulfil such a cytoprotective function by physically serving as a buffer compartment to accommodate the high cytoplasmic Ca 2\u00fe level brought about by the Ca 2\u00fe influx during sonoporation (electronic supplementary material, movie S3, and figure  6 ). This Ca 2\u00fe buffer zone functionality would persist while the sonoporated cell attempts to restore homeostasis by draining excessive Ca 2\u00fe from the cytoplasm. Taken together with earlier findings that showed how transient disruption of membrane integrity via sonoporation may trigger cellular stress activation  [39, 40] , one may deduce that blebbing is after all part of a sonoporated cell's anti-stress machinery.

On the other hand, it is also worth investigating the course of recovery action involved in sonoporation episodes instigated by: (i) ultrasound-triggered cavitation of microbubbles that are positioned at a distance away from the plasma membrane and (ii) stable cavitation in which microbubble oscillation is the defining feature (rather than microbubble collapse as is the case in inertial cavitation). For these investigations, it is essential to make use of meticulous instruments to control the relative distance between the microbubble and the plasma membrane, such as optical tweezers  [41 -43]  or the combined use of laser optics and acoustic radiation force  [44] . We hypothesize that, under both scenarios, blebbing at the sonoporation site may not necessarily occur because the cavitational impact that reached the plasma membrane would consequently be tapered. Instead, less rigorous manoeuvres may be triggered to restore cellular homeostasis. On a related topic, it would be of interest to consider whether and how membrane recovery would take place in more intricate sonoporation scenarios. One particular case worth analysing is the scenario where concurrent induction of multiple sonoporation episodes would occur on the same cell via the cavitation of multiple microbubbles. An example of such case is that of Cell 4 depicted in electronic supplementary material, movie S1, and figure 2. In this multi-site sonoporation example, membrane resealing did not occur, and the cell had seemingly become non-viable. To generalize such an observation, it would be beneficial to study the membrane impact of different parameters related to multi-site sonoporation, including the number, size and positioning of microbubbles attached to the cell. Doing so would render new insight on why the use of bubble-to-cell ratios greater than unity for sonoporation purposes has been shown to increase the chances of cell death  [45] . Note that the recovery dynamics of sonoporation may be different when using nontone-burst ultrasound pulsing waveforms, such as chirps  [46] . It would be relevant to survey this issue as well. A further avenue of investigation worth pursuing is to connect our observations with theoretical biophysics models that describe plasma membrane behaviour during ultrasound exposure  [47, 48] . The pursuit of this foundational study would provide us with a more predictive account of the biophysical conditions under which blebbing would occur at sonoporation sites. In turn, it would create new knowledge on the mechanistic foundations of sonoporation. Such knowledge would be practically relevant to ongoing application development efforts that seek to leverage sonoporation to intentionally disrupt the plasma membrane for therapeutic purposes, such as the delivery of drugs and genes into cells.

An oscillating bubble can release energy upon symmetric collapse in the form of heat, light, and shock wave,  [3]  or a high-speed liquid jet due to bubblebubble interaction  [4] , asymmetric collapse either near a boundary  [2]  or under the influence of an impinging shock wave  [5] . In contrast to damaging ship propellers and hydraulic structures  [6] , the power of cavitation has often been harnessed in biomedical applications for the treatment of cancers by high-intensity focused ultrasound, noninvasive disintegration of kidney stones by shock wave lithotripsy, and ultrasound-mediated drug and gene delivery  [1] . However, understanding the dynamic bubble-cell interaction and its causal relation with the biological consequences still remains to be a significant challenge. Only a few studies have been performed to investigate bubble-cell interaction under well-controlled experimental conditions, using either a small air bubble  [7, 8]  or ultrasound contrast agents as stabilized cavitation nuclei  [9]  in an acoustic field, or a laser-generated millimeter-and micron-size bubble to interact with adherent  [10]  or suspension  [11]  cells. Overall, these previous studies are limited in resolving the transient bubble-cell interaction, associated fluid dynamics, and membrane poration by the cavitating bubble, as well as subsequent transport of macromolecule into the cell. In this Letter, we introduce a method for generating tandem microbubble in close proximity that leads to alternating formation of microjets in opposite directions. The transient bubble-bubble and microjet-cell interaction, as well as resultant microstreaming and vortex formation are characterized by high-speed imaging and microparticle image velocimetry (PIV). Using this method, localized and directional membrane poration in single biological cells can be produced in an orientation and proximity-dependent manner. Experimental setup.-A Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope was configured to incorporate two laser beams for tandem microbubble generation and high-speed cameras for imaging of bubble dynamics, bubble-cell interaction, and PIV of fluid motion [Fig.  1(a) ]. Two Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers of 5 ns pulse duration [MiniLase I (LASER1) and Solo PIV (LASER2), New Wave Research] with wavelength of 1064 nm and 532 nm, respectively, were transmitted through a 63\u00c2 long-workingdistance objective. The incident angle of LASER1 was slightly tilted so that the foci of the two laser beams were separated by a distance of \u00c1 \u00bc 40 m. Each laser beam ($ 30 J) is preferentially absorbed by the fluid medium containing 0.4% Trypan blue in a microfluidic channel [Fig.  1(b) ], generating a microbubble via optical breakdown  [11] . By controlling the release of individual laser pulses using a digital delay generator (BNC 555, Berkeley Nucleonics Corporation), tandem microbubbles with different oscillation phases can be produced. High-speed imaging and PIV.-Two 45 -dichroic mirrors (900dcsp and z532dcrb, Chroma) were used for reflection of the laser beams and simultaneous transmission of illumination light for high-speed imaging. A fiber-optic coupled Xenon flash lamp (ML1000, Dyna-Lite) was used to provide backlight illumination, petitioned into an 80=20 intensity ratio between two high-speed cameras (Imacon 200, DRS Hadland and Phantom v7.3, Vision Research). The Imacon 200 was operated at 1 \u00c2 10 6 frames per second, 50 ns exposure time, and 14 frames per sequence to capture the dynamics of bubble-bubble-cell interaction. The Phantom camera was used to record the subsequent uptake and progressive diffusion of Trypan blue into the targeted cell within 1 min. Moreover, a Shimadzu HPV-1 camera operated at 1 \u00c2 10 6 frames per second, 250 ns exposure time, and 100 frames per sequence was used for PIV. For flow visualization, 2 m polystyrene beads (R0200, Duke Scientific) were added in the medium as tracers at 1 \u00c2 10 9 beads=ml concentration. The acquired images were processed using DaVis 7 software (LaVision, GmbH) for determining the velocity field around pulsating microbubble(s). Cell culture and experimental design.-Rat mammary carcinoma cells maintained routinely in culture (37 C) were trypsinized and reseeded in a 60-mm diameter Petri dish at 10 5 cells=ml concentration one day before the experiment. When cell growth reached about 10% confluence, the culture medium was replaced by saline solution containing 0.4% Trypan blue (T8154, Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature ($ 20 C). Subsequently, two 25-m platinum wires (A-M Systems) were placed in parallel in the Petri dish to form a channel of $10 mm wide and 25 mm long. A 1.0-mm thick glass plate was then placed on top of the platinum wires to form a microfluidic exposure chamber [Fig.  1(b) ]. Trypan blue enhanced laser absorption to facilitate optical breakdown while providing concomitantly a biomarker for membrane poration. Adherent cells of spindle shape were selected and randomly assigned to one of the seven groups. Cells in groups G 1 to G 3 were treated at different orientations (0 and 90 ) with respect to tandem microbubble axis while maintaining the same stand-off distance (SD) of 10 m. Cells in groups G 4 to G 6 were treated at SD \u00bc 20, 30, and 40 m, respectively, while maintaining the same orientation (0 , as used in case G 1 ). In group G 0 (control), cells were treated by a single bubble (B 1 ) produced at SD \u00bc 10 m. Bubble-bubble and microjet-cell interaction.-Similar to shockwave-bubble interaction  [12, 13] , the most effective energy transfer is produced when the collapse time of the bubble matches with the duration of external driving force. By releasing the two laser pulses in tandem with a 4 s interpulse delay, a first bubble (B 1 ) can be generated (at time \u00bc 0 s) that expands to a maximum size of about 50 m before a second bubble (B 2 ) of similar size is produced [Fig.  1(c), 4 s ]. Consequently, the collapse of B 1 is coupled with the simultaneous expansion of B 2 , leading to asymmetric deformation of the bubbles with microjets formation [Fig.  1 (c), 6 s] under the influence of secondary Bjerknes forces  [14] . Thereafter, B 2 begins to collapse with its elongated portion in contact with B 1 contracting rapidly, producing a second microjet moving away from B 1 [Fig.  1(c ), 8 $ 12 s]. This alternating formation of microjets moving in opposite directions along the axis of the tandem microbubble (movie 1 in the supplementary material  [15] ) is not observed during the symmetric expansion and collapse of a single microbubble (movie 2 in the supplementary material  [15] ) of comparable size produced by one laser [Fig.  1(d)] . Similar bubble dynamics have been observed in an unconstrained fluid medium using spark-generated vapor bubbles of millimeter size  [16] . Flow field around the pulsating microbubble(s).-Following the 1st optical breakdown, the fluid is initially pushed outward from the center of B 1 before reversing the direction of flow during subsequent collapse after the maximum bubble expansion (movie 3 in the supplementary material  [15] ). In contrast, the initial symmetric expansion of B 2 is quickly distorted with its proximal end being sucked in by the collapsing B 1 , leading to the formation of the first microjet [J 1 in Fig.  2 (a), 6 s]. The acceleration of J 1 produces a microstreaming impulse with a maximum flow velocity on the order of 10 m=s near the jet tip (5 to 6 s). Upon maximum expansion, the elongated B 2 collapses asymmetrically and generates the second microjet (J 2 ) that moves away from B 1 (7 to 11 s). As a consequence of the alternating microjet formation, two pairs of vortices are generated around B 1 and B 2 , one rotating clockwise and the other counterclockwise [Fig.  2(b) ], reaching a maximum vorticity of 350 000 s \u00c01 at 6 s. Vortex formation from laser-induced single bubble ($150 m in diameter) near a microfludic channel wall was recently reported with a maximum vorticity of 100 000 s \u00c01  [17] . Cell membrane poration.-Because of the unique flow pattern produced by the pulsating tandem microbubble, we examined its influence on the morphology and membrane permeability of individual adherent cells (Rat mammary carcinoma) placed nearby. As shown in Fig.  3 (a), a cell placed on the axis of B 1 and B 2 with a SD of 10 m from the proximal surface of B 2 (case G 2 ) can be deformed significantly [see Fig.  2 (a) for an example of case G 1 ] while its counterpart in the symmetric flow field of a single ) and its interaction with an adherent cell (pointed to by arrow). The asymmetric deformation with resultant formation of alternating microjets in opposite directions along the tandem microbubble axis (movie 1 in the supplementary material  [15] ) is not observed during the symmetric expansion and collapse of the laser-generated single microbubble of comparable size (movie 2 in the supplementary material  [15] ). bubble is only strained mildly (case G 0 ). The microjetflow-cell interaction along the tandem bubble axis causes a micron-scale bending and shear deformation of the cell [65 s in Fig.  3 (a) for case G 2 ] that leads to localized membrane disruption and uptake of Trypan blue within 1 min. In comparison, when a cell is placed at the same SD but rotated by 90 from the axis of B 1 and B 2 [Fig.  3(a) , case G 3 ] or subjected to the symmetric expansion and collapse of a single bubble (case G 0 ), a much milder strain with no concomitant Trypan blue uptake is observed. Also, no appreciable membrane poration is produced when the cell is located either off the tandem microbubble axis with a SD greater than 10 m or on the axis with a SD greater than 40 m. Quantitatively, the membrane poration produced by the tandem microbubble shows a clear dependence on orientation [Fig.  3(b) ] and stand-off distance [Fig.  3(c) ]. Statistically significant (p < 0:05) increase in Trypan blue uptake is observed in G 1 and G 4 compared to G and G 6 , respectively, with maximum probability for Trypan blue uptake produced at SD \u00bc 20 m along the tandem microbubble axis. Localized and directional membrane poration.-The membrane disruption is highly localized. Using time-lapse imaging [Fig.  4(a) ], we can observe a pinpoint entrance of the Trypan blue from the cell surface proximal to the jet impact in 6 s. The dye gradually diffuses and spreads out in the cytosol towards the distal end in 24 s, with subsequent directional entrance and staining of the cell nuclei by 42 s (movie 4 in the supplementary material  [15] ). Using our setup, the cell can be quickly fixed by a perfusion flow of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, started in about 10 seconds after the tandem microbubble-cell interaction. Subsequently, cell location and jet impact direction are registered by laser-produced markings at the bottom of the Petri dish [Fig.  4(b) ]. Scanning electron microscopy of the treated cell reveals highly localized membrane disruption with single or dual pore formation at the site of membrane surface facing the microjet impact. The pore size varies from 200 nm to 2 m [Figs.  4(c)  and 4(d)] . Because the cell is treated in Trypan blue solution (with no Ca 2\u00fe content), active repair of the pore is likely to be significantly compromised with smaller than 1 m spherical vesicles observed at the disruption site [see Fig.  4(d) ]  [18, 19] . Therefore, the observed pore size may represent an upper limit in membrane disruption produced by the tandem microbubble under physiological conditions. Discussion and summary.-A new method is developed to produce localized and directional membrane poration on single cells with high precision and reproducibility. The pore size can be varied from nanometer to micrometer   [19] . Because jet diameter is usually about one-tenth of the maximum bubble size, the potential energy accumulated by a single bubble with comparable size to a cell (i.e., $20 m) is limited and insufficient to produce measurable membrane disruption when collapsing near a boundary  [20] . By confining the bubble generation in a quasi-2D thin layer, and furthermore, by transferring and focusing energy through tandem microbubble interaction, we have demonstrated the feasibility for generating pinpoint mechanical forces for highly localized membrane poration. Microjetting induced flow shear stress and resultant bending (and stretching) of the cell body may contribute to the observed pore formation. The flow-induced shear stress () near the microfluidic channel (height \u00bc 2h \u00bc 25 m) surface can be estimated by \u00bc \u00f0V j =h\u00de where is dynamic viscosity of the medium and V j is jet speed. The estimated maximum shear stress in our setup is about 1 kPa, which is within the range of previously reported critical shear stress of 0.1 kPa for cell detachment  [20]  and water-hammer pressure of 3 kPa for jet impact induced membrane rupture  [9] . Individual cells placed on the axis of the tandem microbubble [see Figs.  1(c ), 2(a), and 3(a)] show different de-grees of bending deformation produced by jet impact and resultant microstreaming and vortex flow. The central portion of the cell directly under jet impact is detached, while one or both distal ends of the cell remain attached, leading to a significant stretching of the cell membrane. The stretching ratios of material lines located at different orientations and SDs from the tandem microbubble (data not shown), estimated based on PIV images, show a good correlation with the membrane poration. It is envisioned that the technique developed in this work can be easily integrated in microfluidics and thus possessing great potential in high-throughput biosynthesis and bioengineering applications, and for mechanistic investigation of cavitation-induced bioeffects.
