<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Transient sonoporation can essentially be epitomized by two fundamental processes: acoustically induced membrane perforation and its subsequent resealing. To provide insight into these processes, this article presents a new series of direct evidence on the membrane-level dynamics during and after an episode of sonoporation. Our direct observations were obtained from anchored fetal fibroblasts whose membrane topography was imaged in situ using real-time confocal microscopy. To facilitate controlled sonoporation at the single-cell level, microbubbles that can passively adhere to the cell membrane were first introduced at a 1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio. Single-pulse ultrasound exposure (1-MHz frequency, 10-cycle pulse duration, 0.85-MPa peak negative pressure in situ) was then applied to trigger microbubble pulsation/collapse, which, in turn, instigated membrane perforation. With this protocol, five membrane-level phenomena were observed: (i) localized perforation of the cell membrane was synchronized with the instant of ultrasound pulsing; (ii) perforation sites with temporal peak area ,30 mm 2 were resealed successfully; (iii) during recovery, a thickened pore rim emerged, and its temporal progression corresponded with the pore closure action; (iv) membrane resealing, if successful, would generally be completed within 1 min of the onset of sonoporation, and the resealing time constant was estimated to be below 20 s; (v) membrane resealing would fail for overly large pores (.100 mm 2 ) or in the absence of extracellular calcium ions. These findings serve to underscore the spatiotemporal complexity of membrane-level dynamics in sonoporation.</p></div>

Compared with other membrane perforation approaches, sonoporation is perhaps unique in that spatiotemporal control can be readily exercised. In particular, spatial localization of sonoporation may be realized by introducing synthetic microbubbles as sonoporation agents in the vicinity of cells <ref type="bibr" coords="1,491.30,506.88,49.70,8.91;1,309.82,519.12,64.16,8.91" target="#b7">(Hernot and Klibanov 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,377.27,519.12,64.39,8.91" target="#b14">Liu et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,444.96,519.12,77.20,8.91" target="#b30">Suzuki et al. 2011)</ref>. As well, temporal specificity may be achieved in sonoporation by commanding the time of ultrasound application to controllably instigate microbubble pulsation or collapse (corresponding to stable or inertial cavitation, respectively) that generates the mechanical force required for membrane puncturing <ref type="bibr" coords="1,483.11,592.75,57.88,8.91;1,309.82,605.04,21.85,8.91" target="#b5">(Ferrara et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>To complement the strong efforts to develop sonoporation-based therapeutic applications, it is vital to establish the details of fundamental biophysical processes involved in sonoporation. Of significant relevance are two membrane-level processes that epitomize the notion of sonoporation: (i) how membrane perforation is induced by ultrasound-microbubble interactions, and (ii) how the membrane remodels itself after an episode of sonoporation. Acquiring direct observation of these processes is, however, not a straightforward task.

Alternatively, ultrafast optical microscopy has frequently been leveraged to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of microbubble-cell interactions over the course of acoustic cavitation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,135.82,273.63,78.07,8.91" target="#b11">(Kudo et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.89,273.63,67.56,8.91" target="#b19">Ohl et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,54.29,285.86,73.68,8.91" target="#b17">Nejad et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,130.92,285.86,77.61,8.91" target="#b26">Sankin et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.54,285.86,69.57,8.91" target="#b36">Zhou et al. 2012)</ref>.

In approaching this task, we surmised that real-time confocal fluorescence microscopy, if coupled to a well-characterized acoustic exposure apparatus, is a suitable experimental methodology because it offers both high imaging contrast (via specific labeling of cell membrane) and sufficient temporal resolution (needed to render membrane dynamics over the course of sonoporation).

As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,474.80,126.36,8.10,8.91" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, the singleelement piston transducer (1-MHz frequency, 25.4-mm diameter; Wuxi Beisheng Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China) of the ultrasound module was driven by a twostage electronics setup that was an arbitrary waveform generator for pulse shape programming (33120A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a 50-dB broadband amplifier (2100L, Electronics &amp; Innovation, Rochester, NY, USA). The nose cone-shaped acrylic waveguide, on which the ultrasound transducer was mounted, was a custom-designed device with 75 mm height and 8 mm nose diameter.</p><p>Cell chamber. The cell chamber used for experimentation was an in-house design, and a top view of it is shown in the lower left inset of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,444.05,304.16,8.06,8.91" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.

The window was created by carving out that particular segment of the polystyrene dish and sealing the base of the resulting void with a cover glass less than 160 mm thick (Type 1, Vitromed, Basel, Switzerland). Note that for 1-MHz ultrasound, the wavelength of which was approximately 1.5 mm in water-solvent solutions, the cover glass can be assumed to be an acoustically thin layer.</p><p>Platform alignment. A 4-mm detachable tip was included at the nose of the waveguide to facilitate physical alignment between the waveguide, the microscope's scan plane and the cell chamber. The alignment was realized by placing the tip in contact with the base of the cell chamber's observation window and positioning it at the center of the microscope's field of view. This process was visually guided by observing through the microscope's eyepiece. To avoid interfering with the microscope's bright-field imaging operations, the waveguide was angled at 40 with respect to the surface normal of the cell chamber. After the alignment was completed, the 4-mm tip was detached from the nose of the waveguide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="2,309.82,623.66,104.91,8.70">Cell preparation protocol</head><p>Cell culturing. MRC-5 fetal fibroblasts (CCL-171, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were used as our cell model. It is a commonly used cell line in transdermal drug delivery. The cells were first cultured in monolayer form inside a culture flask using minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco 41500-018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SV30160.03, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco 11840-030, Invitrogen). Throughout the culturing, the cells were placed inside a 37 C incubator environment with 5% carbon dioxide. Before the experiment, the fibroblasts were harvested by trypsinizing the cells. The working density of the harvested cell extract was 150,000 cells/mL, as determined with a hemocytometer.</p><p>Cell seeding within cell chamber. The harvested fibroblasts were seeded onto the cover glass of the cell chamber as follows. First, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,275.31,522.17,10.15,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> (Step 1), a polystyrene coverslip was patched onto the upper side of the cell chamber's observation window to create a temporary enclosure. The coverslip was securesealed on three sides of the window, and a 1-mm gap was left open on the remaining side to serve as an injection port for substance transfer. After that, 0.6 mL of the trypsinized fibroblast extract (i.e., around 90,000 cells) was pipetted into the enclosure. Their attachment to the bottom cover glass was fostered by adding 5 mL of fresh MEM to the cell chamber and placing it inside the incubator for 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,136.00,657.15,12.68,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure" coords=""/> Step 2).</p><p>Membrane labeling. After cell attachment to the cover glass, the cell chamber's MEM was replaced with a staining solution to fluorescently label the cell membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,75.52,715.09,12.57,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure" coords=""/> Step 3). In this work, CellMask Orange (C10045, Invitrogen; absorption maximum: 554 nm, emission maximum: 567 nm) was used to stain membrane phospho-lipids at a working concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The dye was dissolved in a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer (pH 7.4) containing 137 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 5.4 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 0.25 mM sodium phosphate, 0.44 mM potassium phosphate, 1.3 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 4.2 mM sodium bicarbonate and 20 mM HEPES (4-[2hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid). Note that this particular dye was chosen for our investigation in view of its slow internalization rate-an important characteristic for maintaining high membrane labeling specificity without running the risk of co-labeling subcellular organelles. The staining reaction was allowed to take place for 15 min in a dark environment, after which the enclosure was gently washed with HBSS.</p><p>Microbubble supplementation. To provide artificial nucleation sites for instigation of sonoporation during ultrasound exposure, lipid-shelled microbubbles were injected into the observation window after cell membrane staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,367.29,654.09,12.68,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure" coords="3,382.87,654.09,24.61,8.91" target="#fig_4">Step 4</ref>). Targestar P commercial-grade microbubbles (TS-108, Targeson, San Diego, CA, USA) were used in this work; they had an average diameter of 2.2 mm, with less than 1.7% of the microbubble population larger than 5 mm. The microbubbles were added at a density of 150,000 bubbles/mL, and thus, the average cell-to-bubble ratio was approximately 1:1. To facilitate microbubble adhesion to the apical surface of the cell, the cell chamber was flipped upside down for 15 min (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,77.77,101.83,12.74,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure" coords=""/> Step 5), so as to allow buoyant forces to lift the microbubbles toward the anchored fibroblasts. The cell chamber was then gently reverted to its original upright position. Subsequently, the temporary enclosure of the observation window was removed by using forceps to take away the polystyrene coverslip (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,237.80,163.17,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, Step 6), and the cell chamber was gently filled with HBSS to a working volume of 25 mL. The cell chamber was placed onto our customized imaging platform within 10 min for experimentation.</p><p>Extracellular calcium ion depletion. To gain comparative insight into post-sonoporation membrane recovery dynamics, an experiment was conducted in the absence of extracellular calcium ions (Ca 21 ), which are known to play an active role in membrane recovery processes. For this experiment, the cell loading procedure was the same as for the other experiments, except that a Ca 21 -free HBSS buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 3 mM magnesium chloride and 20 mM HEPES was used as the cell chamber buffer after staining. Also, 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (E-3889, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) extracellular Ca 21 chelators were added to the buffer solution to inactivate Ca 21 externalized from the cell due to intrinsic ion transport. Note that for this experiment, a 5-min wait period was allowed after the addition of Ca 21 -free buffer for the chelation reaction to take effect before exposure.</p></div>

The waveform's center frequency was 1 MHz (i.e., in line with the transducer's center frequency), and the pulse length was set to be 10 cycles. These settings yielded a pulse duration of 10 ms. Pulse triggering was carried out manually during experimentation to facilitate single-pulse ultrasound activation of microbubble pulsation or collapse. The waveform amplitude was adjusted to a level that corresponded to a nominal peak negative pressure of 0.85 MPa, as calibrated by hydrophone measurements described below. This pressure value, well considered to be within the typical levels used in imaging diagnostics <ref type="bibr" coords="4,238.66,635.80,46.88,8.91;4,54.29,648.09,21.85,8.91" target="#b8">(Humphrey 2007)</ref>, was chosen so as not to trigger cavitational activities in a microbubble-free medium.</p><p>Field calibrations. To characterize the acoustic exposure conditions in situ, free-field mapping of the peak negative pressure in front of the waveguide (with tip detached) was performed inside a 37 C water bath using a needle hydrophone (HNR-0500, ONDA, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) that was facing the nose of the wave-guide. Note that the needle hydrophone was mounted onto a three-axis scan stage (ASTS-01, ONDA) to facilitate high-precision positioning. Also, to avoid needle tip contact, the hydrophone holder included an ad hoc guard rail in the form of a wooden straw whose length was 1 mm longer than the needle hydrophone. In other words, all field measurements were conducted at a minimum distance of 1 mm from the nose of the waveguide.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,427.42,187.70,9.61,8.91" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> (xz-plane map), the axial maximum of the free-field peak negative pressure was approximately 4 mm away from the waveguide nose. Because this value was rather close to the physical length of the detachable waveguide tip, the pressure magnitude at the free-field axial maximum can be inferred as the incident level of ultrasound field impinging on the cell chamber. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,383.45,273.63,10.15,8.91" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> shows the single-pulse waveform detected by the hydrophone at the free-field axial maximum. The peak negative pressure was found to be 0.85 MPa. This value was regarded as the nominal peak negative pressure in our investigation.</p><p>To examine the homogeneity of incident ultrasound field along the surface of the cell chamber, 40 -angle cross-sectional mapping of the peak negative pressure was carried out at the free-field axial maximum. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,377.56,384.08,9.61,8.91" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> (xy-plane map), the 150 3 150-mm 2 area (marked by the dashed box) corresponding to the largest scan plane size used in this work only had limited variations (1%) in the free-field peak negative pressure. Note that standing waves (with pressure anti-nodes up to twice the free-field value) would inevitably emerge in situ because of the strong acoustic reflection at the base of our cell chamber, which was essentially interfaced with the microscope's lens. Nevertheless, we restrained the confounding effect of these standing waves on our experimental results by using a single short ultrasound pulse (10 cycles) to instigate cavitational activity. Indeed, this uncertainty in the in situ acoustic pressure would not affect the validity of our findings because all our observations were directly attributed to episodes of microbubble pulsation or collapse.</p></div>

To elicit the fluorescence of cell membrane (stained by the CellMask Orange dye), a laser excitation wavelength of 543 nm was used; for signal detection, a reception band of 555-643 nm was used. A 403 oil lens (420461-9910, Carl Zeiss) was used for image capture. It had a numerical aperture of 1.3 and a refractive index of 1.518. As discussed in the Results section, the confocal microscope's pinhole size, pixel dwell time and image size were varied to adjust the frame rate of planar raster scans as necessary to image membrane perforation (a fast membrane Scan configurations. In this work, the scan plane positions were set to correspond to the apical and basal surfaces of the cell so as to monitor membrane dynamics adjacent to and away from the microbubble (adhered to the apical side). In addition to performing planar scans of the cell, single-line scans were conducted to capture the fast-changing temporal dynamics of the membrane along one line of interest along an image plane. Moreover, bright-field images were acquired in parallel to locate the microbubble position in situ. Cine loops were then formed to visualize the time-course dynamics of membrane-level processes in sonoporation.</p><p>Data analysis. Image frames were imported into Im-ageJ (Version 1.47n, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) for quantitative analysis of sonoporation features. Specifically, the pore area and its long-axis diameter were measured for multiple episodes of sonoporation (N 5 7) by demarcating the pore contour in each frame and measuring the contour size. A time profile of these measures was formed correspondingly, and temporal-peak values were identified. Using the GraphPad Prism software (Version 5, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), pore measurements for cells with successful resealing were statistically compared against those that failed to reseal (based on the Student t-test). Also, saturation growth regression was performed to estimate the perforation time constant for each episode of sonoporation (between the onset of pore formation and the instant when pore area reached a maximum). To quantify recovery dynamics after sonoporation, the post-resealing scar area was gauged as similar to the pore size measurements. As well, the resealing time constant was estimated through an exponential decay regression (from the instant at which pore area reached a maximum to the time point of pore closure). The time constants and observed resealing outcomes (success or failure) were correlated against temporal-peak pore area using Spearman's nonparametric analysis to determine their relationship.</p></div>

As a representative example, Supplementary Video 1 (acquired at the rate of 16.39 frames/s [fps]) shows a cine loop of membrane perforation induced by a single collapsing microbubble that was originally adhered to the apical surface of an anchored fibroblast before ultrasound exposure. The exact position of this field of view is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,383.28,454.02,3.81,8.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, which also provides a time series image set of the perforation site.</p><p>Three salient observations can be noted from Supplementary Video 1 and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,461.12,490.78,3.96,8.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref>: (i) pore creation was synchronized with the time course of microbubble collapse; (ii) the resulting pore size (5.3-mm long-axis diameter) was greater than the microbubble size (1.8-mm diameter); (iii) membrane resealing commenced within 5 s after the incidence of sonoporation and was completed within 1 min. It should be emphasized that the perforation process was confined to a local region of the cell membrane. Indeed, the size of the perforation site was much smaller than the fibroblast's dimensions (length 5 142.5 mm, width 5 49.5 mm). In general, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,381.49,625.76,9.61,8.91" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> (left), the temporal-peak pore area generated using our single-microbubble mediated approach was less than 30 mm 2 for cases with successful resealing (N 5 7). The corresponding long-axis diameter was smaller than 6.5 mm (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,436.31,674.87,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>, left box).</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,183.15,375.02,5.07,8.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref> illustrates how temporary membrane disruption (on the apical side of the cell) was synchronized with a vibrating microbubble. In this case example, the microbubble was originally 2.2 mm in size before ultrasound exposure. The brightfield image shows that when a single ultrasound pulse was applied (at the 0-s time point), the microbubble did not collapse, but was triggered to pulsate with a minimum diameter that was measured to be 1.2 mm. Also, the microbubble was deflected from its original position  and drifted toward the lower-left direction in the field-ofview. Over this process, membrane tearing along the apical surface was apparent, while the basal side of the cell remained intact. The maximum long-axis length of this tearing was found to be 10.0 mm (observed 6 s after ultrasound pulsing). Resealing took place afterward and was completed after 30 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="8,54.29,641.95,168.63,8.70">Membrane perforation is a rapid process</head><p>As can be observed from Supplementary Video 1, the onset of membrane perforation was a rapid process. To further exemplify this observation, we conducted a single-line scan of the membrane dynamics at a temporal resolution of 1 ms. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,261.97,703.20,3.81,8.91" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, the scan line was placed across the microbubble to capture the correspondence between the onset of microbubble collapse and membrane perforation. In this case, before exposure to ultrasound, the microbubble had a diameter of 1.4 mm. At the time of ultrasound pulsing, the microbubble collapsed immediately, and the membrane was perforated concurrently. Note that 1 ms after ultrasound pulsing, pore size was measured to be 3.3 mm, which was 2.4 times greater than the microbubble size. As such, it can be inferred that a blasting effect was generated on the cell membrane by the ultrasound-induced microbubble collapse.</p><p>Additional insight into the rapid nature of membrane perforation can be gained from Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,469.38,666.39,8.10,8.91" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, in which time traces of the measured pore area are plotted for seven sonoporation episodes induced using our single microbubble-mediated approach. As can be observed, the first 5 s after the onset of perforation was generally the time window in which the pore would expand rapidly toward its maximum size. Indeed, except for one case (the uppermost curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,154.58,319.96,7.76,8.91" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>), the pore stopped expanding within 12 s after sonoporation. The perforation time constant, as determined from saturation growth regression analysis, was found to be generally below 5 s, except for the outlier case mentioned (see box-whisker plot given in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,106.28,381.31,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>, left box). Note that no statistically significant correlation (r 5 0.4286) was found between the perforation time constant and temporal-peak pore area.</p><p>Membrane recovery: Tens of seconds in duration and a multi-faceted process Resealing of the perforation site generally commenced within 10 s after the onset of perforation. As shown in the time traces of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,213.67,482.30,8.10,8.91" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, the time from the instant at which pore size reached a maximum to the completion of pore closure was generally on the order of tens of seconds. For the seven sonoporation episodes, their resealing time constant derived from an exponential decay regression analysis was found to range between 6 and 20 s (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,93.29,555.93,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>, right box). This time constant was statistically correlated (r 5 0.8571, p , 0.05) with temporalpeak pore area for a particular episode of sonoporation. Such a correlation is after all expected because it is reasonable for larger pores to require a longer time to reseal.</p><p>The course of action involved in post-sonoporation resealing was found to be rather multi-faceted from a biological standpoint. As can be noted from Supplementary Video 1 as well as Figures <ref type="figure" coords="9,167.68,654.09,5.07,8.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="9,193.82,654.09,3.81,8.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, during the recovery stage, the rim of the disrupted membrane exhibited a stronger fluorescence level, which indicates a local increase in phospholipid content. Also, after membrane resealing was completed, the original perforation site exhibited strong fluorescence, and this area was measured to be on the same order as the temporal-peak pore area (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,95.60,740.02,8.10,8.91" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, middle box). These observations suggest that post-sonoporation scarring of the membrane may emerge. Another observation of interest is that, although membrane perforation induced by ultrasound-triggered microbubble collapse or pulsation was localized, other segments of the cell membrane may be disrupted over the process. In particular, away from the perforation site, the membrane exhibited a striated pattern postexposure that was not observed pre-exposure. Indeed, as shown in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="9,391.30,418.13,10.15,8.91" target="#fig_3">3b</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="9,420.33,418.13,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>, such a membrane striation pattern was evident over the surface of the entire sonoporated cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="9,309.82,470.16,204.19,8.70">Membrane may not reseal if pore size is too large</head><p>It is worth emphasizing that post-sonoporation membrane resealing might fail for excessively punctured perforation sites. Evidence of this phenomenon is given in Supplementary Video 2, which features a cine loop of how a sonoporated cell has not resealed its perforation site after 6 min into the sonoporation episode (frame period: 3 s). Indeed, a time-lapse enlargement of the pore was apparent starting 10 s after the onset of sonoporation, and this process lasted until 3.5 min into the episode, after which the pore slowly began to undergo resealing. A still-frame rendering of this observation is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,396.15,617.28,3.81,8.91" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. Note that the apical pore was measured to be 32.6 mm in long-axis diameter (generated by ultrasound-triggered collapse of a 1.5-mm-diameter microbubble). Another point worth noting in this example is that in addition to excessive puncturing on the apical surface of the cell, mild but reversible membrane tearing on the basal side of the cell can also be observed. The maximum size of the basal tear was 12.5 mm, a value that is in line with our microbubble pulsation-induced membrane tear shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,533.43,727.73,3.81,8.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Such a difference between apical and basal pore sizes may help explain why the apical pore has not resealed, even 30 min after exposure.</p><p>To characterize the relationship between resealing outcome and pore size, seven different episodes of sonoporation with failed resealing were identified, and their temporal-peak pore area and long-axis diameter were measured. Compared to cases with successful resealing, sonoporated cells that failed to reseal exhibited a substantially larger pore area that was one order of magnitude higher (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,122.78,589.75,8.10,8.91" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, right box). Also, the long-axis pore diameters in these cases were all larger than 10 mm (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,73.10,614.33,8.46,8.91" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>, right box). These results indicate a strong correlation between pore size and failure of post-sonoporation resealing, and this was statistically confirmed through a Spearman's rank correlation analysis that examined the size distribution of both resealable pores and nonresealed ones (r 5 0.8603, p , 0.001).</p></div>

It can be observed that after the onset of membrane perforation, the pore had not resealed after 20 min (in contrast to typical completion of resealing within 1 min). Also, no indication of membrane recovery initiation can be found (e.g., no thickening was observed at the rim of the disrupted membrane). Indeed, pore size gradually expanded over time: its long-axis length was 5.6 mm initially, but increased to 8.7 mm after 20 min.</p></div>

In line with this objective, our real-time cine loops have provided a direct visualization of how the onset of plasma membrane perforation is synchronized with a cavitating microbubble (Supplementary Video 1). These direct observations reveal that sonoporation can be realized by a microbubble undergoing physical collapse (inertial cavitation; see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,172.70,494.59,4.23,8.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) or non-collapsing pulsation (stable cavitation; see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,189.49,506.88,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). They also illustrate how membrane resealing, if successful, would typically be completed within 1 min after the onset of sonoporation (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,75.75,543.64,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).

Further analysis of our imaging observations allowed us to gain quantitative insight into the dynamics of perforation and resealing in sonoporation. Temporal-peak pore area was found to be a key factor influencing resealing outcome (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,114.59,629.57,4.23,8.91" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) and recovery duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,240.85,629.57,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_7">7</ref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this investigation represents the first demonstration of the temporal course of membrane-level events involved in sonoporation. It can in essence be considered an effort to acquire new epitomizing evidence on the spatiotemporal dynamics of sonoporation. It is uniquely positioned between previous observations that have revealed phenomena either upstream or downstream of the actual perforation process. For instance, our results are distinguished from upstream findings that illustrate how cavitation-induced jetting would lead to membrane puncturing <ref type="bibr" coords="11,497.19,408.66,43.79,8.91;11,309.82,420.96,21.85,8.91" target="#b19">(Ohl et al. 2006)</ref>, as well as how the extent of membrane effect can be modulated by controlling the microbubble's distance from the membrane <ref type="bibr" coords="11,435.16,445.48,76.50,8.91" target="#b36">(Zhou et al. 2012)</ref>.

In particular, we found that membrane resealing is not necessarily a definite process that is always executed successfully. In cases where pore size was excessive, the sonoporated membrane was observed to remain perforated 30 min into the onset of sonoporation (Supplementary Video 2 and Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,347.61,654.10,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Also, for post-sonoporation resealing to be initiated, the presence of extracellular Ca 21 is vital (Supplementary Video 3 and Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,445.26,678.62,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). On the basis of these findings, it can be readily deduced that membrane resealing is inherently a complex process that depends on various biophysical factors.</p><p>Our direct observations have also provided new clues to the course of action involved in post-sonoporation membrane resealing. One common topographic feature of sonoporated cells undergoing membrane resealing is the emergence of a thickened rim at the perforation site <ref type="bibr" coords="12,54.29,126.36,34.21,8.91">(Figs. 3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="12,91.80,126.36,33.58,8.91">5 and 8)</ref>. The temporal progression of this rim was found to correspond to the pore closure action. Regardless of whether membrane integrity is ultimately restored, pore rim thickening is likely to be an essential feature of membrane resealing because such a feature is not present when the resealing process is inhibited via extracellular Ca 21 depletion (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="12,199.02,199.99,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). On review of the cell biology literature, we found that this feature is essentially similar in appearance to the concentric zones of actin and myosin observed in recovering single-cell wounds <ref type="bibr" coords="12,88.10,249.10,108.01,8.91" target="#b0">(Benink and Bement 2005)</ref>. As actin and myosin are essentially components of a cell's cytoskeleton, it may well be possible that post-sonoporation membrane resealing is a cytoskeleton-dependent process. Two other recovery-related membrane features of our results are worth noting: (i) scarring of successfully resealed perforation sites, and (ii) striation of the membrane surface away from the perforation site (Figs. <ref type="figure" coords="12,81.93,347.26,5.07,8.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="12,110.32,347.26,3.66,8.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). The first feature may be attributed to the closure action of the thickened rim, or it may be the result of other mechanisms such as exocytotic patching of intracellular vesicles and organelles that are also rich in phospholipids <ref type="bibr" coords="12,124.23,396.31,127.17,8.91" target="#b29">(Sonnemann and Bement 2011)</ref>. Explanation of the second feature would require a more detailed analysis of the cell's cytomechanical balance after sonoporation. It may well be possible that the cytoskeleton, which plays a central role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell, is directly involved in eliciting the membrane striation patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head coords="12,132.71,500.68,74.27,8.93">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>When exploiting sonoporation for biomedical applications, membrane perforation and its subsequent recovery are often regarded as routine processes that are presumed to take place because trans-membranous transport is known to be enhanced on an immediate basis. Although such an assumption is not invalid, it inherently omits membrane-level dynamics, which are important from a biophysical perspective. To gain insight into this topic, we devised a customized ultrasound exposure platform with real-time confocal microscopy capabilities to acquire new direct evidence of how, at the single-cell level, membrane perforation typically occurs in an episode of single microbubble collapse triggered by a single ultrasound pulse. In addition, we directly observed how post-sonoporation membrane recovery takes place in situ. Taken together, these experimental findings serve well to highlight the transitory nature of sonoporation at the membrane level. We anticipate that our series of direct observations presented here can serve as mechanistic motivation for further efforts that seek to optimize the realization of sonoporation from a more biologically centered perspective in which the biophysical pathways involved in membrane perforation are taken into account.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,78.58,353.13,438.09,8.02;3,78.58,363.28,438.08,8.02;3,78.58,373.44,438.05,8.02;3,78.58,383.59,438.05,8.02;3,115.63,393.69,364.04,8.02;3,96.12,89.38,403.09,254.55"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
